[Contracts](/contracts/live-host-core) / [Subgraph](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) / [Guides](/guides/live/overview)

## Smart contracts

We have added new smart contracts for live betting:

- [`HostCore`](/contracts/live-host-core) in Gnosis chain for games and markets storing.
- [`LiveCore`](/contracts/live-client-core) in Polygon Mumbai chain for bets storing.
- [`Relayer`](/contracts/live-relayer) in Polygon Mumbai chain for processing a new bets.

## Subgraph

We have added new [Subgraphs](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) for indexing of new smart contracts:

- `HostCore` subgraph for indexing of `HostCore` contract in the Host chain.
- `LiveCore` subgraphs for indexing of `LiveCore` contracts in the Client chains.

## Azuro Live Betting API

We have added a new API for bets registering and processing. This API allows to place an [`order`](/concepts/glossary#order) (signed bet request) and track its status.

- `POST /orders` endpoint for adding a new order.
- `GET /orders/:id` for retrieving an order actual state.

## Conclusion

With implementing of Live betting feature we're expecting a significant increase in betting turnover and an interest in Web3 betting at all.

We've tried to make a technical implementation of the feature as easy as possible.
