# 12/13 SDK v1.0.0

## [useRedeemBet](/sdk/write-hooks/useRedeemBet)

The props for the submit function have been modified. As a result, the `useRedeemBet` hook can now accept an array of bets to redeem, enabling multiple redeem to be performed at once.

## [useOutcome](/sdk/watch-hooks/useOutcome)

If initial values `initialOdds` or `initialStatus` weren't provided, the `useOutcome` hook will automatically retrieve the initial values. The boolean flags `isOddsFetching` and `isStatusFetching` indicate whether the initial values are being fetched.
