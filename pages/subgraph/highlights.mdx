# Highlights

### Limits

TheGraph has a limit of returning a maximum of 1000 elements per request, with a default of 100 elements. Keep this
limit in mind when building your queries. [Read how to paginate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/#pagination).

### Indexing errors

In rare cases indexing errors of new data may occur in subgraph nodes. In that case queries will throw an error with no data by default.
We're reacting fast on such accidents. But while it isn't fixed, you can add param `subgraphError: allow` to your queries to ignore these errors and work with existing data.

### Addresses

When working with TheGraph, all address values are stored in lowercase. This means that when passing variables to
queries, it's important to convert the transmitted value to lowercase, or use the `_contains_nocase` postfix.

### IDs

When working with TheGraph, efficiency matters. The secret sauce lies in their unique `id: ID!` (TheGraph IDs) for @entity directives in schemas.
These IDs, when used in queries, speed up request execution time.

To avoid mess with TheGraph ID, Azuro entities use prefixes in their IDs (Azuro IDs), e.g. `sportId` for sports and `gameId` for games.
To craft TheGraph `ID`, Azuro combining entity parameters which make it unique.

Want to use, for example, Game or Condition TheGraph IDs in your code? It's as easy as this:

```ts
const gameEntityID = `${liquidityPoolAddress.toLowerCase()}_${gameId}`
const conditionEntityID = `${coreAddress.toLowerCase()}_${conditionId}`
```

[Check out the full list of TheGraph ID getters](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Azuro-subgraphs/blob/main/api/src/utils/schema.ts)\
_And, if you're copying these getters, remember to toss in addresses in lowercase._

### Entity Duplications

There can be several `LP` contracts within a single blockchain network. There are several reasons for this, such as
managing different currency pools or addressing risk management concerns.

Each `LP` contract can contain multiple `Core` contracts, with each `Core` contract differing in terms of the logic
used for different casino games or pre-match/live betting. For example, the logic for pre-match/live betting may
differ from that used for other casino games.

<Callout type="warning">
  The presence of multiple identical contracts in the Azuro Protocol can lead to entities with the same Azuro IDs (e.g. `gameId`, `conditionId`). This is
  because entities created on different contracts may share the same ID, which can make it difficult to distinguish between them.

  For example, different `LP`s may have the same games with the same `gameId`, while conditions created on `Core` contracts
  may have the same `conditionId`.

When interacting with entities in the Azuro Protocol, it's important to use the `coreAddress` and `lpAddress` properties
to identify the specific contract to which the entity belongs.

For example, when querying for games, you should include the `lpAddress` as a filter to ensure that you are only retrieving
games from the correct `LP` contract. Similarly, when placing bets, you should include the `coreAddress` to ensure that
the bet is being placed on the correct `Core` contract.

By using these additional properties to identify the specific contract and entity, you can help prevent issues related
to duplicate IDs and ensure that your application is able to function as intended.
