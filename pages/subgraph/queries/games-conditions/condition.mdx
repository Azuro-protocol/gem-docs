**List of condition statuses:**

- **Created**: The condition has been created and is available for betting.
- **Resolved**: The condition has been resolved, and the outcomes have been determined.
- **Canceled**: The condition has been canceled, and any associated bets may be voided.
- **Paused**: The condition has been temporarily paused, likely due to game delays or other interruptions.
