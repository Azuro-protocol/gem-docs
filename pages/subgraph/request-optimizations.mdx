# Request Optimizations

**TL;DR**:
The subgraph collects historical data, and the lookup time for queries increases with more data.
To optimize query execution time, consider using **simple queries**, **pagination** and **direct filters** based on **timestamps and/or IDs**.
If your query is complex, it's beneficial to break it down into simpler queries.

### Create Simple Queries

Avoid creating complex queries. Instead, split entities like `game` and `conditions`.
First, request games, then retrieve conditions with a filter based on the [game ID](/subgraph/highlights#ids) list.
The `conditions` entity is the heaviest, so by separating them, you can create a progressive UI:

1. Display a full skeleton while loading game info.
2. Show game info and a skeleton instead of markets.
3. Fully render all data once conditions are loaded.

```ts
// SLOWER:
// query all data with nested entities by one request
const { data, loading } = useQuery(ALL_GAME_LIST_WITH_CONDITIONS_COMPLEX_QUERY)
...

// FASTER:
// split requests to game list base info (sport, league, participants, etc),
// then fetch markets for each game
const GameList = () => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(GAMES_QUERY)

  if (loading) {
    return <Skeleton />
  }

  return (
    <div className="space-y-2">
      {
        data?.games?.map((game) => (
          <GameCard key={game.id} data={game} />
        ))
      }
    </>
  )
}

const GameCard = ({ data }) => {
  const { id } = data
  const { data: conditions, loading } = useQuery(CONDITIONS_QUERY, {
    variables: {
      where: {
        game: id,
      },
    },
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <GameInfo data={data} />
      {
        loading ? (
          <MarketsSkeleton />
        ) : (
          <Markets data={conditions} />
        )
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Filter Data by Timestamps

The subgraph stores all historical data, and for many requests, there's no need to go through it entirely. This significantly speeds up queries.

For example, when requesting upcoming games for pre-match markets, filter them by the start date, ensuring it's greater than the current time:

```ts copy
const nowInSeconds = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)

const where: Game_filter = {
  startsAt_gt: nowInSeconds,
}
```

### Use Direct Filters

If you need to filter data, aim for direct filters. The use of nested filters (ending with an underscore, like `game_` in `Condition_filter`) can slow down requests.

For instance, suppose you want to retrieve `conditions` for specific games, using the `gameId` (valid across all chains) as part of the URL. In this case,
you can easily convert `gameId` to the TheGraph `ID` of the game using the formula `<lp_address_lowercase>_<gameId>`.
[Read about IDs in Highlights section](/subgraph/highlights#ids)

```ts
const gameId = '12345'

// SLOWER
const where: Condition_filter = {
  game_: {
    gameId,
  },
}

// FASTER
const where: Condition_filter = {
  game: `${LP_ADDRESS_LOWERCASE}_${gameId}`,
}
```
