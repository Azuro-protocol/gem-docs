### 🌟 Objective

Develop a fully functional application using Azuro protocol that has the UI and UX of a trading platform. Participants can use the code base of the Example project as a starting point: https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/polymarket-example. 

This example project already has a basic orderbook-style UI, showing liquidity and odds for different outcomes. The main objective of this grant project is to add the missing features and complete the development of a trading UI application on Azuro.

### 💰 Grant Amount

5,000 USDT

### 🎯 Key Tasks

- Integrate the Azuro protocol to handle market creation, odds updates, and market resolves with the UX that appears as a trading book
- **Implement the following features:**

1. Display probabilities/odds as percentages and rename them to ‘price’ instead of ‘odds’.

2. Represent liquidity in an orderbook format, displaying available liquidity at different price points.

3. Replace the yes/no format with named outcomes and show each outcome with its probability represented as a percentage.

4. Improve the user interface and experience to closely match an orderbook trading platform (you may use Polymarket as reference).
