### 🌟 Overview

This grant supports builders to create an onchain event tracker that will report large and interesting bets or liquidity transactions as they happen and send alerts about them to the Azuro Twitter account. 

### 💰 Grant Amount

1,000 USDT

### 🎯 Key Tasks

1. Fetch data from the Azuro subgraphs, making periodic requests to the endpoints to listen for new events.
2. Implement logic to filter the fetched data for the interesting bets. Pre-define criteria for what constitutes interesting events: large bet size, unusually high odds, large amount deposited into a liquidity pool, etc.
3. Integrate Twitter API:
- Set up a Twitter Developer account and create an app to obtain API keys and projectID.
- Use the Twitter API to send tweets. Libraries like `tweepy` for Python or `twitter` for Node.js can simplify this process.
1. Write a script or program that fetches data from the subgraph, filters the events, and posts updates to Twitter.
