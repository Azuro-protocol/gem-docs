# Second Wave: Live Betting Incentivized Testing


Welcome to the Second Wave of Azuro Live Betting Test Challenge! The second wave is rewarding issues that are found only on the mainnet (Polygon and Gnosis).
This page provides all the details you need to participate in the test, report issues, and earn rewards. All rewards are in Azuro Score points!

## Overview of the Challenge üåü

**Objective**: Help us identify and resolve potential issues in live betting by participating in targeted testing activities.

**Getting Started**: Choose an activity from the testing scenarios below and follow our guidelines to help us, all the while earning Azuro Score points.

## Testing Scenarios üß™

**How to Participate:** Engage in various test scenarios outlined below,
and report your findings using our [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Live-Betting-Bug-Report/issues).
Your insights are invaluable in helping us improve!

- **Cheat Bet:** Try placing a bet right after the outcome of an event is already known (e.g. you manage to place a bet that a goal will be scored,
right after the goal has been scored already).
- **Odds Discrepancies:** Report any instances where our odds significantly differ from other platforms.
- **Bug Patterns:** Look out for any patterns in bet acceptance, especially incorrect data or delays in transaction confirmations.

## Reporting Issues üìù

**How to Report:** Found an issue? Report it using our [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Live-Betting-Bug-Report/issues).
The questions provided in the form will guide you through the reporting process.
