## Task clarifications

### Bonus feature: Historical price chart that reflects market dynamics

Fetch historical odds / prices for each pre-match event and display their dynamic change over time in the form of an interactive diagram.

- Transform Azuro’s AMM data into a historical line chart format
- The chart’s x-axis to denote the time period, while the y-axis denotes odds (in form of percentages). Users should be able to select shorter/longer time periods — the chart will zoom in/out (i.e., zooming in to view daily odds and zooming out to view monthly odds).
- Chart should display the exact percentage odds and timestamp when hovering on a specific point

Example:

### Motivating your design choices

Design choices in your project shouldn't be merely cosmetic; they should be driven by a clear idea. Therefore, we suggest creating a new UI tailored to a specific end-user persona or use case. 
Who is your potential user? Is he/she a degen who's unfamiliar with prediction markets and wants to earn fast by betting on the best odds? Then organize the data to display the top events with best odds on your home screen. Is your user a sports betting pro? Then organize the data to display events as a series of championship brackets for separate sports events, etc.‍ Feel free to add new elements, such as a placeholder for promotional banners - you can get inspiration in apps built on Azuro.

Here's how you might approach motivating your design choices by a user persona. For example, you might delineate different demographics based on their age, level of betting expertise, crypto use behavior, location, etc.
