### Required features

1. **Historical price chart that reflects the market dynamics for prediction markets**

Fetch historical odds / prices for each pre-match event and display their dynamic change month over month in the form of an interactive diagram. The x-axis should represent time, with a monthly breakdown, and the y-axis should display the price or odds. Allow users to hover over specific points on the chart to see exact odds/price and timestamp for that moment.

Example:

  width={2000}
  height={700}
/>

2. **Championship bracket for big tournaments**

Find events that are connected to each other as parts of championships and organize them in the form of interactive championship brackets. Allow users to click on each team/matchup to place bets on the match. The bracket should be generated dynamically along with the new events being added to the smart contracts from the data provider.

Example:

<Image
  src="/images/community/bracket.png"
  width={2000}
  height={700}
/>
