# Distribute Freebets

_Read [overview](/guides/freebets/overview) first to understand key features of freebet tool._

## Keynotes

### Request Freebet Contracts
Begin by making a [request to the Azuro Protocol team](https://azuro.typeform.com/freebetpanel) to create Freebet
contracts for your use. Once approved, you will gain access to our Freebets admin panel, and your new contracts
integrated into our subgraphs. As the contract owner, you have the flexibility to withdraw
funds from the marketing budget at any time. Additionally, Freebet contracts will be deployed exclusively
for your affiliate address, ensuring that your funds are allocated solely to your frontend.

### Provide Liquidity
To check the liquidity balance, use the `balanceOf(freebetAddress)` function on the token
contract. You can top up your contract by simply sending tokens to your freebets contract address, just as you would with
a regular ERC-20 transfer.

### Withdraw Liquidity
When you wish to withdraw liquidity from the contract, call the `withdrawReserve(amount)`
function. Keep in mind that only tokens not reserved for Freebets can be withdrawn.
To release reserved tokens, use the `resolvePayout(freeBetIds[])` function, especially when customers have not
resolved their Freebets (i.e., they haven't claimed their bets).

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend limiting the IDs provided to the `resolvePayout` function parameters to avoid errors during transaction
  execution.
</Callout>

### Locked Reserve
You can check the amount of locked tokens that cannot be withdrawn by using the `lockedReserve`
function on the Freebet contract.

### Budget Limitation
Please note that we provide you with the flexibility to distribute Freebets
without a budget limitation. However, if your customers claim Freebets for an amount exceeding what you've provided
to the contract, they will encounter an error during the smart contract execution call.

### 3. Create a New Freebets Campaign
**To create a new Freebets campaign, provide the following details:**
- Campaign title
- Network
- Expiration date
- List of freebets data: address, amount, min odds for each freebet.

You can provide freebet data by direct input, or by parsing a "csv" file (click button "Open CSV file" or just drag-n-drop it).

Please keep the format: `address, amount, min.odds` (the data for each address must start with a new line).

<Callout type="warning">
  Please don't put more than 1000 addresses to a campaign.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Distribution of freebets doesn't lock any liquidity before claim. You can create as much freebets as you want (even if available balance doesn't cover total amount).
  But we do not recommend abusing this feature: when trying to use the freebet, the customer will receive an error if the available balance is not enough.

If you have duplicated addresses, all rows with duplicates will be highlighted as a warning (yellow).
It's up to you whether to submit duplicates (in that case user will receive 2 freebets) or remove them.

If you have invalid rows, all of them will be highlighted in red. Fix them before submitting the form.
