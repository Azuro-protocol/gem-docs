# Get Games

To fetch data you should use [Azuro Subgraph](/subgraph/overview). The following query represents main fields required
to present a game info.

```graphql
query Games {
  games {
    sport {
      name
    }
    league {
      name
      country {
        name
      }
    }
    participants {
      name
      image
    }
    startsAt
  }
}
```

[Try it yourself in GraphiQL](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/azuro-protocol/azuro-api-gnosis-v3/graphql?query=query+Games+%7B%0A++games%28first%3A+1%29+%7B%0A++++...Game%0A++%7D%0A%7D%0A%0Afragment+Game+on+Game+%7B%0A++sport+%7B%0A++++name%0A++%7D%0A++league+%7B%0A++++name%0A++++country+%7B%0A++++++name%0A++++%7D%0A++%7D%0A++participants+%7B%0A++++name%0A++++image%0A++%7D%0A++startsAt%0A%7D&operationName=Games)


## Fetch pre-matches

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Requesting all games, including those that have long been over, can put unnecessary strain on the GraphQL node and
  cause performance issues. In general, it's best to only request the data that you need for your application.
</Callout>

If you only need to display games that are currently in progress or scheduled to start in the future, you can use the
`startsAt` field in the query to filter out games that have already ended. For example, you could modify the query to
only retrieve games that are scheduled to start in future:

```graphql
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(where: $where) {
    ...Game
  }
}
```
```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      startsAt_gt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    },
  },
})
```

  Note that the value is calculated in seconds.
</Callout>


## Fetch top 10 games (by turnover)

It's possible to sort games in the query by the volume of bets using the `orderBy` argument in the GraphQL query.
By default, games are sorted by their start time, but you can sort them by other fields such as the total amount of bets
placed on the game.

```graphql
query Games {
  games(
    first: 10,
    orderBy: turnover,
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    ...Game
  }
}
```


## Fetch specific sport games

```graphql
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(where: $where) {
    ...Game
  }
}
```
```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      sport_: {
        name: 'Football',
      },
    },
  },
})
```


## Best practices

### Get games with active outcomes

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      hasActiveConditions: true,
    },
  },
})
```

This parameter filters games that don't have a single active condition to bet on, or in other words, games that have
at least one Condition not in the paused/cancelled status. This ensures that only games with available betting options
are returned in the query results. Most likely you will always use this parameter.

### Filter games by `LP` address

Since Subgraphs contain data from different `LP` contracts, it's possible to have duplicated games across multiple
`LP` contracts. In order to avoid issues related to duplicated data, it's important to identify which `LP` contract
your application will interact with and use the corresponding address to filter the data. This ensures that only relevant
data is retrieved and reduces the risk of conflicts and errors. It's recommended to carefully consider which `LP`
contract to use based on your specific use case and business requirements.
[Get more information](/apis/subgraph/highlights#entity-duplications).

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      liquidityPool_: {
        address: LP_ADDRESS,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  From ["GraphQL" section](/reference/graphql#specificity):

  _When working with Subgraphs, all address values are stored in lowercase. This means that when passing variables to
  queries, it's important to convert the transmitted value to lowercase, or use the `_contains_nocase` postfix._
