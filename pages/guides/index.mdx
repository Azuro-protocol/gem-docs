## Getting Started

Welcome to the Azuro guide on creating your custom frontend. This guide will show you how to make a new betting interface or enhance an existing one.

**To start building with Azuro:**

- Go to our [Tutorial](/guides/tutorial). It will guide you through the necessary steps to create your betting dApp on Azuro Protocol.

- Then, to get your betting dApp up and running, you'll also need to go through the [SDK: making it work](guides/sdk/overview) section and tweak all the necessary components to activate the hooks.

**NB:** for instructions on manual data access, see the [Advanced (manual)](guides/advanced/overview) section where we explain how to use different GraphQL queries.


### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a basic understanding of:
- JavaScript;
- Web3 ([wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/single-page/#getting-started), or other similar lib);
- GraphQL (If you want to make manual requests instead of using the SDK.)

Learn about [the subgraph and Azuro protocol entities here](/subgraph/highlights).


### Getting Rewards (Affiliate Wallet)

To direct rewards to your wallet, include your wallet address as the `affiliate` parameter in bet transactions. [Read about rewards distribution here](/concepts/basic/rewards).

```js {1, 8}
const AFFILIATE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // Your wallet address to earn rewards

lp.bet(
  core,
  amount,
  deadline,
  {
    affiliate: AFFILIATE_ADDRESS,
    data,
    minOdds
  }
)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Please exercise caution when entering your affiliate address in the production environment.
  If you give the wrong address, we can't fix or move associated bets and rewards to a different address.**
  Double-check your affiliate address before proceeding. It's crucial to ensure accuracy.

  Being diligent will help prevent problems with bet calculations and reward distribution.
  If you have any uncertainties or need help, feel free to reach out to our support team.

### Effort Estimate

Building a dApp on Azuro takes approximately one week, considering the complexity of the logic involved.
Remember that the AzuroSDK is your friend in making this process faster and easier because it contains all
the hooks and utilities to connect your dApp to our smart contracts and betting data.


### Conclusion

This guide is your starting point for innovating in the betting industry using Azuro.
