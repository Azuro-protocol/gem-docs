# Installation

<Callout type="info">
There're two ways to use AzuroSDK: 
1. The first is for those who want to take a sample dApp we created and build on top of it.
2. The second is for those who don't need an example project and can make a dApp from ground up that interacts with Azuro protocol as easily as our pre-built example.

Below, you'll find guides to install AzuroSDK for each of these cases.
</Callout>

## 1. To build on top of our sample dApp

1. **Clone the Azuro SDK**: Use Git to clone the repository from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk.git` in your terminal.
2. **Go to the Example Directory**: Navigate into the example directory with `cd sdk/examples/nextjs`.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies for running the example. Note that the SDK itself does not require a separate installation.
4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server using `npm run dev`. This will get your example application up and running.
5. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
