The `SocketProvider` is designed to help the subscription functionality keep track of market changes in real-time during live games, a feature particularly useful for Watch Hooks.

For both pre-match and live games, the market updates include:

- Stopping and unstopping the market.
- Adjusting the odds for different outcomes.

#### Usage

Wrap your application in `SocketProvider`.

```tsx {1, 8, 10}
import { SocketProvider } from '@azuro-org/sdk'


function Providers(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { children } = props

  return (
    <SocketProvider>
      {children}
    </SocketProvider>
  )
}
```
