# Get Bets History

## Bet Info

To get information about the user-placed live bets, you can use the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query LiveBets(
  $first: Int, 
  $skip: Int, 
  $where: LiveBet_filter, 
  $orderBy: LiveBet_orderBy
) {
  liveBets(
    first: $first, 
    skip: $skip, 
    orderBy: $orderBy, 
    orderDirection: desc,
    where: $where, 
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    ...LiveBet
  }
}

fragment LiveBet on LiveBet {
  id
  betId
  status
  amount
  odds
  createdAt
  potentialPayout
  payout
  result
  selections {
    odds
    result
    outcome {
      id
      outcomeId
      condition {
        id
        conditionId
        status
        gameId
      }
    }
  }
  isRedeemed
  isRedeemable
  txHash
  core {
    address
    liquidityPool {
      address
      tokenSymbol
    }
  }
}

```

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      actor_starts_with_nocase: userWalletAddress,
    },
  },
})
```

Each `liveBets` item represents the result of a transaction.
To preserve consistency, there is a `selections` field in the data that contains an array of data about each bet.

<Callout type="warning">
Live bets lack specific game information due to the storage of live games exclusively within the [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) subgraph, providing access solely to the `gameId`.

```graphql {11}
selections {
    odds
    result
    outcome {
      id
      outcomeId
      condition {
        id
        conditionId
        status
        gameId
      }
    }
  }
```

To get game data, you'll need to make a request to the [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) subgraph, utilizing the `gameId`.

```graphql
query Game($gameId: BigInt) {
  games(
    where: { gameId: $gameId }
  )
    sport {
      name
    }
    league {
      name
      country {
        name
      }
    }
    participants {
      name
      image
    }
    startsAt
  }
}
```
</Callout>

## Bet Status

The `status` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Accepted`, `Canceled`, and `Resolved`. Until the outcome the bet was made on is resolved, the status of the bet will be `Accepted`. During the `Accepted` status of a bet, it can be regarded as in progress - `Live`.

```ts
const isLive = bet.status === BetStatus.Accepted
```

It's important to check if bet status is `Accepted` to handle the situation when game is finished and the results are resolved.


## Bet Result

The `result` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Won`, `Lost`.

```ts
const isWon = bet.result === BetResult.Won
const isLost = bet.result === BetResult.Lost
```

Note that until the outcome is resolved `result` will be `null`.

## Market and Selection Names

```ts
import { getMarketName, getSelectionName } from '@azuro-org/dictionaries'

const marketName = getMarketName({ outcomeId })
const selectionName = getSelectionName({ outcomeId })
```

## Pagination

There can be a lot of bets from one user and there can be a problem with fetching all of them at once.

<Callout type="warning">
  From ["GraphQL" section](/subgraph/highlights#limits):

  TheGraph has a limit of returning a maximum of 1000 elements per request, with a default of 100 elements. Keep this
  limit in mind when building your queries. [Read how to paginate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/#pagination).
</Callout>

```graphql
query BetsHistory($first: Int!, $skip: Int!) {
  liveBets(first: $first, skip: $skip, subgraphError: allow) {
    ...LiveBet
  }
}
```

```ts
const PAGE_SIZE = 100

const [ page, setPage ] = useState(1)

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    skip: (page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE,
    first: PAGE_SIZE,
  },
})
```
