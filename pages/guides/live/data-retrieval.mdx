# Live data retrieval

All the live games and markets data is stored in the [`HostCore`](/contracts/live-host-core) smart contract in the `HostChain` (currently is a Gnosis chain)
and can be retrieved via a [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) subgraph.

Data structure is almost the same as the one in the main Subgraph for prematch core contracts.

<Callout type="info">
  Key differences in the entities structure comparing to prematch subgraphs:

  - Removed all entities and events related to bets (bets, freebets, expresses) and contracts (cores, liquidity pools).
  - Removed `selection` entity and its relations.
  - Entity `condition` doesn't have an `isExpressForbidden` field.
  - Event `GameShifted` changed to `GameUpdated` (triggers by changing game status and/or start time).
  - Event `ConditionShifted` completely removed.
</Callout>

Typical data feed lifecycle:

1. `Game` appears in the `LiveDataFeed` subgraph in the `Created` state. It means that the game is in live state.
2. `Conditions` start to appear in this game (usually they start to appear almost when the game starts and finish appearing in 5-10 minutes).
3. During the game each `Condition` can change its state between `Paused` and `Created`. Also condition's odds can be changed.
4. `Game` finishes and its status changes to `Finished`.
5. After some period `Conditions` start to finalize their status to `Resolved`/`Canceled`.
6. After all `Conditions` are resolved, the game change its status to `Resolved`.

## How to display live games and markets

Here we'll describe the logic of displaying live games and their markets.
Supposed that you already have a frontend with setup prematch games.

### Load live games

When game goes live, it saves its id (so the same game in prematch and live subgraphs have the same `gameId` value),
but it's stored in another smart contract, and you should load its info from another subgraph called [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints).

We recommend you to call a snapshot of live games almost the same way you did it for prematch games (see [Get Games](/guides/prematch/get-games) section), but you need to filter them by `Created` status:

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      status: 'Created',
      hasActiveConditions: true, // Avoid this parameter if you want to get the game with no available markets
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="warning">
  While most of the games that we provide in prematch will go live, we don't guarantee it for each particular game.
  Consider this when planning your UX.
</Callout>

<Callout type="feature">
  If you want to effectively update your games list without querying big snapshots each time, you need to listen to the following events in the `LiveDataFeed` subgraph: `NewGame`, `GameUpdated`, `GameCanceled`.
  For each new event you can get its `gameId` field and retrieve an actual game's info.
</Callout>

### Load markets

For each live game you can request its markets (called `conditions`) the same way you do this for prematch games (see [Prepare game markets](/guides/prematch/markets-and-outcomes) section).

<Callout type="warning">
  Take into consideration that markets appear after the game created in the `HostCore` smart contract.
  It means that this is a normal situation if a game doesn't have any live markets for a while.
  You should continue to request game markets all the time and be ready to add a new ones until the game is finished.
</Callout>

### Get realtime markets updates

As for prematch games, live game's markets are constantly updated:

- Market can be stopped and unstopped.
- Outcomes odds can be changed.

For market stop/unstop action you need to listen to new `ConditionStopped` events in `LiveDataFeed` subgraph and then request the actual condition's state.

For odds changes you need to listen to our `HostCore` smart contract event `OddsChanged` (the same way as described in [Real-time Odds Updates](/guides/prematch/real-time-odds-updates) section for prematch, just use the `HostCore` contract).

### Finish a game

When game finishes, its status changes on `Finished` until it has unsettled markets.
When all markets are settled, its status changes on `Resolved`.
