# Live betting overview

Live betting, also known as in-play betting, allows users to place bets on sport events as they are happening.
Unlike traditional betting, which is done before an event starts, live betting offers dynamic odds that change as the game progresses.

In Azuro we are providing a live betting in the most user-friendly way to make it fast and convenient.
It means that the user needs only to approve a spending limit of the betting token (only once) for our `Relayer` smart contract,
and then he can place his bets just by signing messages in his EVM wallet.

Technically, in Azuro, live betting feature is split by two major parts:

- [Bets management](/guides/live/place-a-bet).
