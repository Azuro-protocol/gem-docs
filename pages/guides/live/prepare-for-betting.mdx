# Prepare user wallet for betting

After you [retrieved games and markets](/guides/live/data-retrieval), you can start to create a betting flow.
But before your users can start to place their bets, they need to prepare their wallets for betting with the following steps:

### Top up the native currency

The user needs some small amount of native currency to mint test tokens and give an approval to our Relayer smart contract for spending his betting tokens.

Currently, we are live in Polygon Mumbai testnet that's native currency is `MATIC`.
To claim some amount for tests, you can use one of the following faucets:

- https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- https://mumbaifaucet.com/
- https://faucet.quicknode.com/polygon/mumbai
- https://faucets.chain.link/mumbai

or just search for `mumbai testnet faucet`.

### Claim test tokens

Bets are placed in ERC20 tokens, currently we support custom `USDT` in Polygon Mumbai testnet.
The contract address of this token is [`0xe656De3EC9eFf1B851e0b39AFFaa1478353885a4`](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xe656De3EC9eFf1B851e0b39AFFaa1478353885a4).

Before a user can start betting, he needs to mint some amount of this token by calling `mint` write method.
We recommend you as a frontend operator to create a convenient interface to do that in 1 click and mint `1000 USDT` to the user's wallet.

<Callout type="warning">
  This token soon will be replaced with a new one called `AZUSD`, that implements a new logic.
  We'll update this guide as soon as we deployed it with a new test stand.

### Give a spending approval

In our live betting architecture users don't make transactions, they just sign a message that contains all the bet information and place an order.
This order then been executed by a [Relayer](/contracts/live-relayer) - special backend service for transactions broadcasting.

<Callout type="feature">
  While we work in a testnet, you can ask users to give an approval to spend an unlimited amount of tokens.
</Callout>

### Summary

After finishing all the steps above your users is fueled up with a native currency (that he will need to claim his winnings)
and some test tokens for betting that are ready to be spent.

Now you can proceed with a [betting flow](/guides/live/place-a-bet) implementation.
