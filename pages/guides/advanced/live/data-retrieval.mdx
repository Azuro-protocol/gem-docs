# Live data retrieval

All the live games and markets data is stored in the [`HostCore`](/contracts/live-host-core) smart contract in the `HostChain` (currently is a Gnosis chain)
and can be retrieved via a [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints) subgraph.

Data structure is almost the same as the one in the main Subgraph for prematch core contracts.

<Callout type="info">
  Key differences in the entities structure comparing to prematch subgraphs:

  - Removed all entities and events related to bets (bets, freebets, expresses) and contracts (cores, liquidity pools).
  - Removed `selection` entity and its relations.
  - Entity `condition` doesn't have an `isExpressForbidden` field.
  - Event `GameShifted` changed to `GameUpdated` (triggers by changing game status and/or start time).
  - Event `ConditionShifted` completely removed.
</Callout>

Typical data feed lifecycle:

1. `Game` appears in the `LiveDataFeed` subgraph in the `Created` state. It means that the game is in live state.
2. `Conditions` start to appear in this game (usually they start to appear almost when the game starts and finish appearing in 5-10 minutes).
3. During the game each `Condition` can change its state between `Paused` and `Created`. Also condition's odds can be changed.
4. `Game` finishes and its status changes to `Finished`.
5. After some period `Conditions` start to finalize their status to `Resolved`/`Canceled`.
6. After all `Conditions` are resolved, the game change its status to `Resolved`.

## How to display live games and markets

Here we'll describe the logic of displaying live games and their markets.
Supposed that you already have a frontend with setup prematch games.

### Load live games

When game goes live, it saves its id (so the same game in prematch and live subgraphs have the same `gameId` value),
but it's stored in another smart contract, and you should load its info from another subgraph called [`LiveDataFeed`](/subgraph/overview#live-endpoints).

We recommend you to call a snapshot of live games almost the same way you did it for prematch games (see [Get Games](/guides/prematch/get-games) section), but you need to filter them by `Created` status:

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      status: 'Created',
      hasActiveConditions: true, // Avoid this parameter if you want to get the game with no available markets
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="warning">
  While most of the games that we provide in prematch will go live, we don't guarantee it for each particular game.
  Consider this when planning your UX.
</Callout>

<Callout type="feature">
  If you want to effectively update your games list without querying big snapshots each time, you need to listen to the following events in the `LiveDataFeed` subgraph: `NewGame`, `GameUpdated`, `GameCanceled`.
  For each new event you can get its `gameId` field and retrieve an actual game's info.
</Callout>

### Load markets

For each live game you can request its markets (called `conditions`) the same way you do this for prematch games (see [Prepare game markets](/guides/prematch/markets-and-outcomes) section).

<Callout type="warning">
  Take into consideration that markets appear after the game created in the `HostCore` smart contract.
  It means that this is a normal situation if a game doesn't have any live markets for a while.
  You should continue to request game markets all the time and be ready to add a new ones until the game is finished.
</Callout>

### Get realtime markets updates

As for prematch games, live game's markets are constantly updated:

- Market can be stopped and unstopped.
- Outcomes odds can be changed.

To receive updates, utilize the Socket API. Begin by creating a new socket instance.

```ts
// For development
const socketUrl = wss://dev-streams.azuro.org/v1/streams/conditions
// For production
const socketUrl = wss://streams.azuro.org/v1/streams/conditions

const socket = new WebSocket(socketUrl)
```

You can now subscribe to updates by passing condition IDs to listen.

```ts
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
  action: 'subscribe',
  conditionIds: [ '123456789' ],
}))
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure to unsubscribe from updates for conditions that are not in use.
  ```ts
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({
      action: 'unsubscribe',
      conditionIds: [ '123456789' ],
    }))
  ```
</Callout>

Afterward, you should listen for new data messages. The `message.data ` object holds the updated condition status and odds. Additionally, other data is utilized to calculate the minPrice for live betting.

To handle market stop/unstop actions, monitor the `state` field. If it is present, update the condition status in your UI.

For changes in odds, examine the `outcomes` field. If it is present, update the odds for the corresponding outcome in your UI.
<Callout type="info">
  Upon making a subscription request, you will receive all data associated with the subscribed conditions.
</Callout>

```ts
enum ConditionStatus {
  Created = 'Created',
  Resolved = 'Resolved',
  Canceled = 'Canceled',
  Paused = 'Paused'
}

type SocketData = {
  id: string // condition id
  state?: ConditionStatus // condition status
  margin: number
  reinforcement: number
  winningOutcomesCount: number
  outcomes?: Array<{
    id: number // outcome id
    price: number // current odds
    clearPrice: number // current odds without marginality
  }>
}[]

socket.onmessage = (message: MessageEvent<SocketData>) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(message.data.toString())

  data.forEach(data => {
    if (data.outcomes) { // new odds received
    }

    if (data.state) { // new condition status received
    }
  });
}
```

### Finish a game

When game finishes, its status changes on `Finished` until it has unsettled markets.
When all markets are settled, its status changes on `Resolved`.
