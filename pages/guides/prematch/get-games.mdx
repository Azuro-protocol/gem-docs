# Get Games

## Fetch games

To fetch data you should use [Azuro Subgraph](/subgraph/overview). The following query represents main fields required
to present a game info and its markets with outcomes.

If you only need to display games that are currently in progress or scheduled to start in the future, you can use the
`startsAt` field in the query to filter out games that have already ended. For example, you could modify the query to
only retrieve games that are scheduled to start in the future:

```graphql
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(
    first: 1000
    where: $where
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    gameId
    slug
    startsAt
    league {
      name
      slug
      country {
        name
        slug
      }
    }
    sport {
      name
      slug
    }
    participants {
      image
      name
    }
    conditions {
      conditionId
      isExpressForbidden
      status
      outcomes {
        currentOdds
        outcomeId
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      startsAt_gt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      hasActiveConditions: true,
      liquidityPool: LP_ADDRESS.toLowerCase()
    },
  },
})
```

### Parameters

```graphql {3-5}
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(
    first: 1000
    where: $where
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    ...
  }
```

#### `first`
&mdash; Limit of returning games, default (if not set) is `100`, maximum is `1000`. [Details](/subgraph/highlights#limits)

#### `where`
&mdash; `Game_filter` allow you to filter result by any field exists in Game. Most required variables described below in ["where" filters section](#where-common-filters).

#### `subgraphError: allow`
&mdash; Allows to get data even if the subgraph has indexing errors. It's better to keep this parameter with every subgraph query. [Details](/subgraph/highlights#indexing-errors)


### "`where`" common filters

There is most required filters to show list of active games:
```ts {4-6}
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      startsAt_gt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      hasActiveConditions: true,
      liquidityPool: LP_ADDRESS.toLowerCase(),
    },
  },
})
```

#### `startsAt_gt`
&mdash; Filter out games which already started. It will be changed in the future, but right now we support only pre-match markets.

We recommend always using it in game lists, as requesting all games without such filters,
even those that have already concluded, can impose unnecessary load on the GraphQL node and potentially lead to performance issues.
In general, it's advisable to request only the data essential for your application's functionality.

<Callout type="info">
  Values of `startsAt` fields are calculated in seconds
</Callout>

#### `hasActiveConditions: true`
&mdash; Get games which have at least one active condition. This ensures that only games with available betting options
are returned in the query results. Most likely you will always use this parameter.

#### `liquidityPool: lp_address`
&mdash; filter games by `LP` address.

Since Subgraphs contain data from different `LP` contracts, it's possible to have duplicated games across multiple
`LP` contracts. In order to avoid issues related to duplicated data, it's important to identify which `LP` contract
your application will interact with and use the corresponding address to filter the data. This ensures that only relevant
data is retrieved and reduces the risk of conflicts and errors. It's recommended to carefully consider which `LP`
contract to use based on your specific use case and business requirements.
[Get more information](/apis/subgraph/highlights#entity-duplications).

<Callout type="info">
  From ["GraphQL" section](/subgraph/highlights#addresses):

  _When working with Subgraphs, all address values are stored in lowercase. This means that when passing variables to
  queries, it's important to convert the transmitted value to lowercase, or use the `_contains_nocase` postfix._
</Callout>


### Sorting parameters
There are two optional parameters to sort query result:
```graphql {6-7}
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(
    first: 1000
    where: $where
    subgraphError: allow
    orderBy: startsAt
    orderDirection: asc
  ) {
    ...
  }
```
#### `orderBy`
&mdash; It may be any field from the game entity - `gameId`, `startsAt`, `turnover`, etc.
#### `orderDirection`
&mdash; How to sort - "A-Z" or "Z-A". Values: `asc` (default) or `desc`.

### Examples
#### Top-10 games with the highest volume of bets
```graphql {3, 6-7}
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(
    first: 10
    where: $where
    subgraphError: allow
    orderBy: turnover
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    ...GameFields
  }
```

#### Specific sport games
In the top of the chapter we defined `slug` field in some fields (sport, league, country). You can build a url structure by them, and use to filter games:
```graphql
query Games($where: Game_filter!) {
  games(
    first: 1000
    where: $where
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    ...GameFields
  }
```
```ts {9-11}
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

const { query } = useSearchParams()
const sportSlug = query.get('sport') // e.g. "football"

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      sport_: {
        slug: sportSlug,
      },
      startsAt_gt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      hasActiveConditions: true,
      liquidityPool: LP_ADDRESS.toLowerCase(),
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please pay attention, that Azuro protocol can release a new sport (e.g. esports, cricket, etc).
  We don't recommend to build navigation by raw usage of `sports` query from the subgraph.
  It's better to keep filter by sports which are supported in your app.
</Callout>
