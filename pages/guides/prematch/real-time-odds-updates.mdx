# Real-time Odds Updates

## Subscribe for odds update

Whenever a bet is placed on an LP (Liquidity Provider) contract, a `NewBet` event is created, causing odds values to change.
By subscribing to this event, the updated odds can be obtained.

In order to display updated odds for each outcome button in the user interface, there is a way to subscribe to
the `NewBet` event for each button.

```ts copy filename="subscriber.ts"
const coreContract = new Contract(CORE_ADDRESS, CORE_ABI, RPC_PROVIDER)

coreContract.on('NewBet', async (...args) => {
  const [ bettor, affiliate, conditionId, tokenId, outcomeId, amount, odds, funds ] = args

  eventEmitter.dispatch('OddsUpadted', {
    coreAddress: CORE_ADDRESS,
    conditionId,
  })
})

coreContract.on('OddsChanged', async (...args) => {
  const [ bettor, affiliate, conditionId, tokenId, outcomeId, amount, odds, funds ] = args

  eventEmitter.dispatch('OddsUpadted', {
    coreAddress: CORE_ADDRESS,
    conditionId,
  })
})

coreContract.on('ConditionStopped', async (...args) => {
  const [ rawConditionId, isStopped ] = args
  const conditionId = String(rawConditionId)

  eventEmitter.dispatch('ConditionStopped', {
    coreAddress: CORE_ADDRESS,
    conditionId,
    isStopped,
  })
})

```

```ts copy filename="OutcomeButton.ts"
type Outcome = {
  outcomeId: string
  condition: {
    conditionId: string
    coreAddress: string
  }
}

const outcome: Outcome = ...

eventEmitter.subscribe('OddsUpadted', (event) => {
  if (
    event.coreAddress === outcome.condition.coreAddress
    && event.conditionId === outcome.condition.conditionId
  ) {
    // Fetch new odds value
  }
})

eventEmitter.subscribe('ConditionStopped', (event) => {
  if (
    event.coreAddress === outcome.condition.coreAddress
    && event.conditionId === outcome.condition.conditionId
  ) {
    // Based on event.isStopped, disable or enable outcome buttons
  }
})
```

<Callout type="warning">
  It's important to note that the `conditionId` and `outcomeId` values on different Core contracts may match.
  Therefore, it's important to do a check at the Core contract address.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  You don't need to subscribe to express core contract. It calls `OddsChanged` event on core contract with every combo bet.
</Callout>

The information on how to fetch odds values can be found in ["Get Odds Values"](/guides/prematch/get-odds-values)
section.


## Core Contracts

It is highly probable that you will interact with multiple core contracts simultaneously. In such cases, multiple
subscribers will be required. GraphQL can be utilized to obtain a list of core contract addresses.

<Callout type="info">
  Filter core contracts from graphql by type. Current active type for prematch core is `pre-match-v2`
</Callout>

```graphql copy
query CoreContracts{
  coreContracts(
    where: { liquidityPool: "<LP_ADDRESS_LOWERCASE>", type: "pre-match-v2" }
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    address
    type
  }
}
```
