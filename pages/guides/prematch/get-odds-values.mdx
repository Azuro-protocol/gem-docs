# Get Odds Values

To clarify, the outcomes are linked to certain markers such that if the value of one outcome changes, all
the others are affected as well. Each condition entity includes two outcomes associated with the same market, creating
various possibilities for obtaining new odds values.

There are three options for fetching odds values:

#### Fetch multiple conditions

This option can be especially useful when you are aware that multiple conditions will undergo updates to their odds.
For instance, if you have subscribed to `NewBet` events and are utilizing batching, you can accumulate conditions and
make a request every 3 seconds.

```js copy
const QUERY = gql`
  query ConditionOdds($where: Condition_filter, subgraphError: allow) {
    conditions(where: $where) {
      outcomes {
        currentOdds
      }
    }
  }
`

const ids = conditions.map(({ id }) => id)

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      id_in: ids,
    },
  },
})
```

Alternatively, you can re-fetch all conditions for a particular game, such as when a user has accessed a game page
and is viewing it.

```js copy
const QUERY = gql`
  query GameOdds($id: String, subgraphError: allow) {
    game(id: $id) {
      conditions {
        outcomes {
          currentOdds
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    id: game.id,
  },
})
```

#### Call `calcOdds` method on the Core contract

```ts
type Outcome = {
  outcomeId: string
  condition: {
    conditionId: string
    coreAddress: string
  }
}

const outcome: Outcome = ...

const coreAddress = outcome.condition.coreAddress
const conditionId = outcome.condition.conditionId
const outcomeId = outcome.outcomeId
const betAmount = '0' // when calculating the odds for outcomes, the bet amount should not be taken into account

const coreContract = new Contract(coreAddress, CORE_ABI, RPC_PROVIDER)
const odds = await coreContract.calcOdds(conditionId, betAmount, outcomeId)
```
