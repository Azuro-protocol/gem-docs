<Callout type="feature">
Also referred to as “Community Airdrop 1”
</Callout>

Community Airdrop 1 comes in 2 snapshots:

---

### Snapshot 1, taken at 23:59:59 UTC, June 10:
- \$AZUR pool 1 of **19,000,000** tokens distributed linearly towards Azuro Score
- \$AZUR pool 2 of **31,262,000** tokens distributed linearly to Azuro Score connected to using Azuro-powered apps (betting)
- \$AZUR pool 3 of **3,000,000** tokens distributed linearly towards Azuro Score received in Phase 1.
- \$AZUR pool 4 of **3,000,000** tokens distributed to the top 3,000 addresses (1,000 each) ranked by consistency. Consistency was measured in number of weeks in which the address has used any Azuro-powered app. This however amounted to 3,484 addresses, 541 of which had exactly 6 weeks of activity. Therefore, in order to determine the 57 addresses who make it into the 3,000 - they were ranked by points received for LPing.
- \$AZUR pool 5 of **738,000** tokens distributed to 738 addresses (1,000 each) which held testnet NFTs.
- In total 50% of tokens are unlocked at TGE, 50% are vested linearly over 183 days, block by block.
    - all tokens up to 1,000 are fully unlocked. This means 43,459 addresses receive more than 50% unlocked tokens. To balance this the 2,207 top receiving addresses receive 45% unlocked and 55% vested.
- Azuro Score holders who have received their score via the [Polygon and GnosisChain drops](/concepts/azuro-score/drops) but have never interacted with the Azuro Protocol on mainnet have been excluded.
