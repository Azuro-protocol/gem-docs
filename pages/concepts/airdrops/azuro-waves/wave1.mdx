## Points multipliers

### Levels multiplier

| Level ID | Level name | Level multiplier | Points needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Grey |  | 0 |
| 0 | Mist |  | 0 |
| 1 | Sky | x1.1 | 50 |
| 2 | Blue | x1.2 | 5 000 |
| 3 | Ultramarine | x1.3 | 20 000 |
| 4 | Bright | x1.4 | 50 000 |
| 5 | Brilliant | x1.6 | 200 000 |
| 6 | Royal | x2 | 500 000 |

Your points are multiplied by the multiplier associated with the Level you have, for as long as you have it.

After the completion of the Wave you will keep your Level minus 1 for the next wave. I.e. if your level at the end of the Wave was for example Ultramarine, you will have the Blue level for the next Wave.

<Callout type="warning">
If you do not see your level in the Waves tab in the Azuro App, make sure to click the ENHANCE button. You can do this at any stage within the Wave.
However, if you never do it and the Wave ends - you will not have any Level Multiplier points.

| Weekly leaderboard position | Multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| 1-10 | 5x |
| 11-50 | 3x |
| 51-500 | 1.25x |
