## About the Azuro Waves

- The distribution of $AZUR will come in Waves and will be 100% linear towards the points accrued by each address.
- The Waves program introduces “Levels” which give point multipliers. This means that all points earned by the eligible activities (which will be 100% transparent), will be multiplied by the level in the Wave which you have.
- Conditions for next waves may change but changes will never be retroactive. There will always be clarity about how points work and how $AZUR will be distributed from the beginning of each Wave.
