# Staking and DEX LP incentives

## Staking

Staking AZUR enables you to earn rewards in AZUR and partner’s tokens.

<Callout type="feature">
The AZUR staking rewards are generated via the Azuro Zero Emissions Model (ZEM). They are not derived from net new token emissions.
</Callout>

#### 1. Staking Rewards

**AZUR staking rewards are currently providing a minimum of 22% APY, starting June 24, 2024.**

See how to stake [below](https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/azur/staking#how-to-stake)


#### 2. Sophon farming program

Starting 23 July 2024, AZUR holders can utilize their AZUR tokens on Sophon's platform to farm Sophon Points (SP). These points will be converted to SOPH tokens once the Sophon Mainnet goes live and they launch the SOPH token.

## DEX LP Incentives

By participating in the DEX LP Incentives program, you can earn rewards distributed over a 90-day period.

**Starting at TGE**: 6,000,000 tokens will be allocated over 90 days.

**Distribution Rate**: Equal distribution block by block, resulting in 66,667 tokens per day or 2,778 tokens per hour.

<Callout type="info">
Your share of the AZUR reward from each block depends on the value and range of your LP position. You do not receive any DEX Farming rewards when the AZUR price is outside your LP position range:

**Narrow Range**: Concentrating your AZUR-WETH liquidity in a narrow price range can significantly boost your rewards. The smaller the range, the higher your reward share, providing an excellent opportunity for increased returns when the AZUR price remains within your chosen range.

**Wider Range**: Spreading your liquidity over a wider range offers more stability and consistent rewards. Covering a broader range ensures that a significant portion of your liquidity is always active in trades, leading to steady returns while still participating in the reward distribution.

</Callout>

To participate in the DEX LP Incentives program, follow these steps:

1. **Add Liquidity**
    - Provide liquidity to the ETH/AZUR pair on Uniswap.
2. **Stake Liquidity Tokens**
    - Stake the liquidity token (NFT) received from Uniswap in the Azuro App.

**Unstaking**

Unstaking is available at any time. There is no unbonding period.
