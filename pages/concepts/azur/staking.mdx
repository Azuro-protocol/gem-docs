# AZUR Staking

Staking AZUR enables you to earn DOUBLE rewards in AZUR and partner’s tokens.

#### 1. Staking Rewards

If you stake before June 26, 2024, you will earn 7.5% staking rewards in AZUR. Reward distribution will happen between 21.07.24 and 25.07.24.

<Callout type="info">
To be eligible for 7.5% rewards, you should start staking before 26.06 and keep your tokens staked until at least 19.07. You are free to stake any amount of tokens.
</Callout>

*The staking rewards are generated via the Azuro Zero Emissions Model (ZEM). They are not derived from net new token emissions.*

#### 2. Sophon farming program (coming soon)

Staked AZUR will be be eligible for Sophon’s farming program. You will be able to use your staked AZUR to farm Sophon. Rewards in the program are in Sophon's native token $SOPH and several other tokens (to be announced by Sophon, soon).

More information on when this starts and how it works will be added shortly.
