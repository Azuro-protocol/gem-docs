### Automated Market Maker

An automated market maker is a smart contract on Ethereum that holds liquidity reserves. Users can trade against these
reserves at prices determined by a fixed formula. Anyone may contribute liquidity to these smart contracts, earning
pro-rata trading fees in return.

### Liquidity Provider (LP)

Someone who deposits ERC20 tokens into a given liquidity pool. Liquidity providers take on price risk and are
compensated with trading fees.

### Liquidity

Digital assets that are stored in a Azuro pool contract, and are able to be traded against by traders.

### ERC20

ERC20 tokens are fungible tokens on Ethereum. Azuro supports all standard ERC20 implementations.

### Factory

A smart contract that deploys Pools and Betting Engine smart contracts.

### Pool

A contract deployed by the Factory that pairs two ERC-20 assets. Different pools may have different
fees despite containing the same token pair.

### Betting Engines

A collective term for contracts that encompass the logic of creating Conditions, accepting bets, computing payouts
for bets, and calculating Affiliate rewards.

### Conditions

Each Market presented on a Pool is called a Condition.

### Market

A sports betting market is a specific category of bet on a certain fixture or event.

### Games

A Game is an entity within Pool's contracts that provides information about a game or event. The Game includes
information about when the match will start, as well as an IPFS hash containing information about the event.
Based on the Game, an unlimited number of Conditions can be created.

### Outcome (Selection)

the simplest type of bet in a bookmaker’s office, the winning of which is determined by the result of a sporting
event - the victory of team(player) 1 or team 2(player), or a draw (if possible).

### Bet

At its core, sports betting is putting money behind an outcome of your choice and getting paid if that outcome is achieved.

### Freebet (Free Bet)

A bet of a specified value for which a bookmaker offers to pay the stake.

### Express

Express is a type of bet where a user can combine outcomes from different Conditions and place them as a single bet.
This bet wins if each of the selected outcomes in the set wins, with the payout coefficient being the product of the
selected Odds taking into account the applied Margin.

### Odds

The ratio of winnings to the stake and bettor also get his wager returned. So wagering 1 at 1:5 pays out 6 (5 + 1).

### Margin

The margin (also referred to as "spread" or "vig/vigorish") is the difference between the probability of a betting
outcome happening and the odds that bettors can place bets with (for this outcome). In traditional
online betting, it is also referred to as the "bookmakers advantage" or "house edge".

On Azuro protocol, margin is one of the immutable properties of a Condition, set at the time of its creation.

### Affiliate

A frontend operator can be apps, widgets, tools, integrations or even standalone products which use the Azuro
liquidity pools and deliver a UI for users to interact with.
