# Azuro stAZUR

Staking AZUR signals your commitment to Azuro. By staking AZUR, you’ll be eligible to earn an estimated ~22% APY, starting 24 Jun 2024 until the end of the staking period. The duration of the staking period is not announced ahead of time.

Further details to be disclosed closer to the end of the staking period.

<Callout type="feature">
Staking rewards are generated off the overall value that is accrued to the Azuro ecosystem. They are not derived off new emissions from the uncirculated AZUR supply.
</Callout>

When staking AZUR, users will receive stAZUR, our liquid staking token that can be used on partner platforms to gain additional rewards from our partners.

Once rewards are distributed, they can be claimed through the staking dashboard, with no restrictions on timing.

<Callout type="warning">
If you staked AZUR using the old contract, you'll continue earning rewards. To receive stAZUR, you must claim it in the [app](https://azuro.org/app/staking).
