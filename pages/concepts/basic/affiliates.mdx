# Frontends (Affiliates)

Frontends can be apps, widgets, tools, integrations or even standalone products which use the Azuro liquidity pools and deliver a UI for users to interact with. While some frontends can copy exisiting products and create new UIs with localization & specialization, more sophisticated developers can go further and create new products altogether, building new pools and other overlays on top of Azuro's infrastructure and underlying liquidity.

In the simplest example (i.e. a betting app like [bookmaker.XYZ](https://bookmaker.xyz)) - by integrating Azuro - the frontend "outsources" liquidity and risk management, while it focuses purely on UX & marketing.

Frontend operators [earn a % of the profits](/concepts/basic/rewards) realized by the [Pools](/concepts/protocol/pools)
(from the part associated with their own users' activity). Each Frontend Operator provides their address to the smart
contract with their users' bets and the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract distributes part of the profits to the frontend address.

Frontend operators have the ability to choose which markets to display on their app. They can select from the list of supported conditions live on the protocol and remove events that are not needed.

Despite the fact that the [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) has no control over whoever connects their front-end
platforms with the Azuro Protocol, the Azuro DAO encourages front-end operators who intend to do so to comply with
any laws applicable to the operation of such platforms.

The Azuro DAO expressly disclaims any liability for the activity of front-end operators who connect their platform with Azuro.
