# Data Providers

A Data Provider is an entity with the necessary [access](/contracts/access) in a Pool to create and cancel events, create, resolve or cancel [Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions) and update the odds. Data Providers are the entities ensuring there are Conditions to predict on, and that the probabilities for these conditions are such that the pool generates a profit from the predicting over time.

At the time of creation of Conditions the Data Provider sets:
1. Total virtual [reinforcements](/concepts/protocol/reinforcement) for each condition and the respective outcomes
2. Margin for each condition/outcomes thus setting the [odds](/concepts/protocol/odds)

The Data Provider receives a share of the profit that is due to the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools). It can be either the Pool owner or any other address, for additional security.

In contracts infrastructure, the Data Provider is represented as an address to which a part of the profit share
[is credited](/concepts/basic/rewards) by [LP](/contracts/lp) after the completion of each Condition.

When it comes to resolving the Conditions, the Data Provider on Azuro follows a certain set of rules, derived from one of the most reputable established sports-betting data sources (https://www.pinnacle.com/en/future/betting-rules).

It is envisioned that there may be multiple data providers active on Azuro at a later stage, therefore these rules may change, evolve, or vary depending on the data provider in the future.
