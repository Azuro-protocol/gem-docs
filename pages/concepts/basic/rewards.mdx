# Rewards


The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s profit that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding reward: [Affiliate](/concepts/basic/affiliates) reward, [LP](/contracts/lp) reward, [Data Provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers) reward, [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) reward.

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (25% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.  For Affiliates the reward is 2% of the betting volume associated with their address in a calendar month (up to a maximum of 70% of the pool’s profit). It is distributed once every month.

| Contributor | Reward | Address |
|---|---|---|
| [Frontends (Affiliates)](/concepts/basic/affiliates) | 2% of betting volume (up to a maximum of 70% of Pool’s profit) | multiple |
| [Liquidity Providers](/contracts/lp) | 25% of Pool’s profit | multiple |
| [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) | 10% of Pool’s profit | `0x77e803ad3a4a52d5ab609451b8ba60cea7a5bea6` |
| [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) | variable* | `0xef18f2f054a7ad2909333051aa42d5c0bb3f92f6` |

<Callout icon="*" type="reference">
The Affiliate rewards (when counted as % of the Pools’ profits) can vary. This variability is made possible the DAO reward which is therefore also variable. I.e. depending on how much is left after the distribution of rewards to the LPs, Data Providers and Affiliates, - the remainder is received by the Azuro DAO. In the event that the rewards of the Affiliates, LPs and Data Providers, exceed the pool profits for the month - the “missing” reward is provided to the Affiliates by the DAO treasury.
