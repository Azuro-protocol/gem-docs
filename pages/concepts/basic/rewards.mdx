# Rewards


The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s revenue (i.e. total bets placed minus total winnings) that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding reward: [Liquidity Providers](/contracts/lp) reward, [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) reward, [Affiliates](/concepts/basic/affiliates) reward, [Azuro DAO](/concepts/azuro-dao/overview) reward.

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (25% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.  For Affiliates (Frontends) the reward is calculated monthly, using the following formula, separately for each chain:
 
Affiliate reward* = (50% of Spread)*(Bet Size) for all bets associated with the affiliate address, resolved in the calendar month.

| Contributor | Reward | Address |
|---|---|---|
| [Frontends (Affiliates)](/concepts/basic/affiliates) | (50% of Spread)*(Bet Size) for all bets associated with the affiliate address, resolved in the calendar month | multiple |
| [Liquidity Providers](/contracts/lp) | 25% of Pool’s profit | multiple |
| [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) | 10% of Pool’s profit | `0x77e803ad3a4a52d5ab609451b8ba60cea7a5bea6` |
| [Azuro DAO](/concepts/azuro-dao/overview) | variable** | `0xef18f2f054a7ad2909333051aa42d5c0bb3f92f6` |

LPs’, DataProvider’s and the DAO’s rewards can happen to be negative. Affiliates’ rewards can be only positive or 0.
