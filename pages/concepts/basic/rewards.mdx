# Rewards


The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s revenue (i.e. total predictions placed minus total winnings) that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding reward: [Liquidity Providers](/contracts/lp) reward, [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) reward, [Affiliates](/concepts/basic/affiliates) reward, [Azuro DAO](/concepts/azuro-dao/overview) reward.

### Liquidity and Data Providers

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (25% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.

### Affiliates (Frontends)

Affiliates' (Frontends) reward is paid monthly, separately for each chain.

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{r l}
\text{Affiliate Reward} &= 70\% \times \text{Affiliate Revenue} \\
&\left(\text{but not higher than the Spread Reward Cap}\right)
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

- **Affiliate Revenue** = Monthly Pool Revenue (preditctions made minus winnings) via the Affiliate address
- **Spread Reward Cap** = (50% of Spread)*(Prediction Size) for all predictions (aka bets) associated with the affiliate address, resolved in the calendar month
- **Spread** = The spread (aka vig, aka margin) for each particular bet
- **Prediction size** = The amount (in respective cryptocurrency) of each particular prediction


### DAO

The DAO reward is calculated by deducting all other rewards from the total monthly Pool Revenue.
