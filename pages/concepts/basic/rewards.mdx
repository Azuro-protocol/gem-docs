# Rewards


The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s revenue (i.e. total bets placed minus total winnings) that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding reward: [Liquidity Providers](/contracts/lp) reward, [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) reward, [Affiliates](/concepts/basic/affiliates) reward, [Azuro DAO](/concepts/azuro-dao/overview) reward.

### Liquidity and Data Providers

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (25% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.

### Affiliates (Frontends)

For Affiliates, the reward is calculated monthly, using the following formula, separately for each chain:

<Formula>
$$
\text{Affiliate Reward} = (\text{50\% of Spread}) \times (\text{Bet Size})
$$
</Formula>

Affiliate reward is capped at 70% of Affiliate Revenue.
This reward is for all bets associated with the affiliate address, resolved in the calendar month.

- **Spread**: The spread (aka vig, aka margin) for each particular bet.
- **Bet Size**: The value of the bet placed.
- **Affiliate Revenue**: Monthly Pool Revenue (bets placed minus winnings) via the Affiliate address.



### DAO

The DAO reward is calculated by deducting all other rewards from the total monthly Pool Revenue.
