# Rewards

The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s profit that is
distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are three types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding reward: [Affiliate](/concepts/basic/affiliates) reward, [Data Provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers) reward, [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) reward. The part of the
profit and loss that is not distributed among these three participants remains to be allocated to the [LP](/contracts/lp)
liquidity providers.

Azuro DAO and Data Providers have the same reward mechanism: after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions),
the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate and added to the contributor reward balance. If the balance
is positive and enough time has passed since the previous withdrawal, the contributor can withdraw their due reward.

The Affiliate reward mechanism differs from that of Azuro DAO and Data Providers. At the moment, in all
[Betting Engines](/concepts/protocol/betting-engines), Affiliates only share in Pool's profits, but not losses. The
calculation of Affiliate rewards is determined individually by each Betting Engine. For example, because profit
calculation for [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) Affiliates is a gas-expensive operation, in withdrawal requests,
Affiliates also provide a list of Condition IDs for which they want to get their reward.

Currently Azuro Pool liquidity providers get the majority share of pool's profits. However, it is expected that the
settings will be updated as per the table below, as usage increases.

| Actor | % share of profit* | Address |
|---|---|---|
| [Liquidity Providers](/concepts/basic/liquidity-providers) | 25 | N/A |
| [Frontends (Affiliates)](/concepts/basic/affiliates) | 60 | N/A |
| [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) | 10 | `0x77e803ad3a4a52d5ab609451b8ba60cea7a5bea6` |
| [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) | 5 | `0xef18f2f054a7ad2909333051aa42d5c0bb3f92f6` |

<Callout icon="*" type="reference">
In the current implementation Frontends receive a commission of 3% of the betting volume for positive conditions (i.e. conditions that generate a profit for the liquidity pool), which is distributed proportionally based on the share of pool revenue contributed by each frontend. On average, this means that frontends can expect to earn around 60% of the total revenue, however this figure may fluctuate due to the current implementation which only takes positive conditions into account and is based on percentage of volume. An update which allows for precise setting of profit distribution is planned for Q4, 2023.
