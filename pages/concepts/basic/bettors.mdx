Players can access the markets via websites, apps or widgets (known as "Frontends") that connect to Azuro to deliver services to end users. An up-to-date list with frontends can be found here: www.azuro.org/frontends

<Callout type="info">
  When accessing markets supported by Azuro, players do not need to make deposits or withdrawals. Although the UX/UI on
  frontends is not overseen by Azuro - the intended use of Azuro's markets is such that players' funds and winnings can
  remain in their possession at all times. Such is the case when each prediction is a transaction with the smart-contract.
  Once the game finishes players just need to claim their winnings from the smart contract (if their prediction won).
