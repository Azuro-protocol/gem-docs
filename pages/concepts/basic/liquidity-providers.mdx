# Liquidity Providers

Providing liquidity into one of Azuro's pools exposes the LP to virtually all betting markets supported by the
respective pool. It's an opportunity to get 1-click exposure to thousands of betting markets.

The liquidity pools earn through the spread embedded in the odds on which bettors place bets. The profit of the
liquidity pool is the the difference between the tokens seeded from the pool into the Conditions and the tokens
returned to the pool after those Conditions are resolved.

The more bettors, and betting there is on the protocol - the higher the likelihood the pool is profitable.
I.e. - the longer the duration of each LP's position - the higher the likelihood that it yields positive return.

<Callout type="alert">
  **RISKS:**
  - There is a significant chance that liquidity positions held under a week can be in the red (in the negative).
  - There is a non-zero chance that this can extend to longer periods of time. It is estimated that for periods above 1 month the likelihood of the pools turning a profit is >99%. But this is not a certainty.

## Liquidity Positions

### Adding Liquidity

When user provides liquidity - his tokens will start to earn with the Pool from the next betting event which will be
created. I.e. user's liquidity gets exposed to betting markets which are created after the user has made a deposit. This
can sometimes mean that the user starts getting real exposure a day or two later.

<Callout type="warning">
  Currently there is a lockup period of **7 days** after user adds his tokens. This means user can provide liquidity for
  7 days or more. Not less.
</Callout>

### Withdrawing liquidity

When user withdraws his liquidity it immediately loses exposure to the pool (i.e. to all the unresolved betting markets).
