# Liquidity Providers

Providing liquidity into one of Azuro's [pools](/concepts/protocol/pools) exposes the LP to virtually all betting markets supported by the
respective pool. It's an opportunity to get 1-click exposure to thousands of betting markets.

The liquidity pools earn through the spread embedded in the [odds](/concepts/protocol/odds) on which bettors place bets. The profit of the
liquidity pool is the the difference between the tokens seeded from the pool into the [Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions) and the tokens
returned to the pool after those Conditions are resolved.

The more bettors, and betting there is on the protocol - the higher the likelihood the pool is profitable.
I.e. - the longer the duration of each LP's position - the higher the likelihood that it yields positive return.

<Callout type="alert">
  **RISKS:**
  - There is a significant chance that liquidity positions held under a week can be in the red (in the negative).
  - There is a non-zero chance that this can extend to longer periods of time. It is estimated that for periods above 1 month the likelihood of the pools turning a profit is >99%. But this is not a certainty.

## Liquidity Positions

### Adding Liquidity

When a user provides liquidity - his deposit is exposed to potential earnings from the next betting event which will be created (i.e. 1-2 days later). However, due to the peculiarity of the Liquidity Tree design the deposit is immediately exposed to markets which bring losses to the pool. This means that in the first few days it is very common that the liquidity position can show negative returns. The more time passes, the more this initial negative skew becomes negligible. I.e. the position becomes aligned with older liquidity positionsâ€™ profitability over time.

<Callout type="warning">
  New liquidity positions experience an initial negative skew. It is most pronounced in the first few days.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  There is a lockup period of **7 days** after liquidity is deposited. This means you can provide liquidity for
  7 days or more. Not less.
</Callout>

### Withdrawing liquidity

When a user withdraws liquidity it immediately loses exposure to the pool (i.e. to all the unresolved betting markets).
