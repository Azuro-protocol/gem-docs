# The Azuro Protocol

The Azuro Protocol is a decentralized protocol that enables peer-to-pool prediction markets without intermediaries. It's built on EVM-compatible blockchains and consists of several smart contracts that handle different aspects of the prediction process, such as liquidity pools, odds, live betting, and payouts. The protocol uses a hybrid oracle/ automated market maker solution to determine the odds of different outcomes and to ensure that the process is fair and transparent.
