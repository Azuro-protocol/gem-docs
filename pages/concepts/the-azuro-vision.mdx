# The Azuro Vision

The human desire to take risk for a potential gain is getting bigger and is more widespread than ever. A generation of degens within and outside of crypto is upon the world. A bet was one of the first forms of contract used by ancient people.

Azuro enters the space with the mission to break down the barriers, creating a protocol dependent on community participation and ownership. A piece if critical on-chain infrastructure which acts as a black hole for liquidity for decentralized predictions & gaming.

Just like how for the Coinbase's and Binance's of the world we need Uniswap's & GMX's, so for the Stake.com's we need decentralized alternatives. These alternatives will be utilizing Azuro's open markets and games humming behind the scenes.

Azuroâ€™s approach to concentrating liquidity can deliver much deeper liquidity vs any centralized options. Azuro's tooling & oracle solutions will be utilized by any blockchain, starting with EVM-compatible ones. And Azuro's open design will allow anyone to launch a prediction site/app with no upfront costs and zero risk management capacity needed. And launch in just a few hours!

Yet, if we are to bring the next billion users on-chain - even this may not be enough. There must be real feature innovation and big UX advancements. The on-chain variant of the industry has to be wild! Leveraging crypto's strengths such as composability, open design and financialization of all applications and wrapping it with risk-taking opportunities... It's the most ripe environment for additional risk overlays on top of existing games, apps, markets, metaverses and the likes.
