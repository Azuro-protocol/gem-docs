# The Azuro Vision

Betting has been around for thousands of years. A bet is one of the first forms of contract used by people. Today
online betting is monopolized by centralized entities. Many use their unchecked control over users' funds to prey on
and manipulate their userbase. They take the lion's share of the profits, and it is nearly impossible for any outsider
to take part in the business of betting.

At the same time - the human desire to take risk for a potential gain is getting bigger and is more widespread than ever.
A generation of degens within and outside of crypto is upon the world.

Azuro enters the space with the mission to break down the barriers, creating a protocol dependent on community
participation and ownership. A piece if critical on-chain infrastructure which acts as a black hole for liquidity
for decentralized predictions & gaming.

Just like how for the Coinbase's and Binance's of the world we need Uniswap's & GMX's, so for the Stake.com's &
Rollbit's we need decentralized alternatives. These alternatives will be using Azuro's open markets and games.

Azuroâ€™s approach to concentrating liquidity can deliver much deeper liquidity vs traditional operators. And
Azuro's open design will allow anyone to launch a prediction site/app with no upfront costs and zero risk management
capacity needed. And launch in just a few days!

Yet, if we are to bring the next billion users on-chain - even this may not be enough. There must be real feature
innovation and big UX advancements. The on-chain variant of the industry has to be wild! Leveraging crypto's strengths
such as composability, open design and financialization of all applications and wrapping it with risk-taking opportunities...
It's the most ripe environment for additional risk overlays on top of existing games, apps, markets, metaverses and the likes.

On-chain betting should not only democratize/decentralize the business of betting & gambling, but reinvent the games
we play and the bets we make!
