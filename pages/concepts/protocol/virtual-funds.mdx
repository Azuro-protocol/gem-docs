  subTitle="Virtual Funds are a mechanism for calculating the probability of outcomes for a Condition"

In CoreBase-based smart contracts, the probability of each outcome within a
[Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions) is stored in the form of Virtual Funds of outcomes.
The greater the value of the Virtual Fund of the outcome relative to the Virtual Funds of other outcomes,
the higher the perceived probability of that outcome, and consequently, the lower the [odds](/concepts/protocol/odds)
for that particular outcome:

<Formula>
$$
o_{i}=\frac{F_{0} + ... + F_{n}} {F_{i}},\text{where } F_i \text{ is a Virtual Fund of the outcome } i
$$
</Formula>

When creating or modifying the odds of outcomes by the [Data Provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers), the total
volume of Virtual Funds for all outcomes within the Condition is calculated using the following formula:

<Formula>
$$
F=R-sum(bets)-max(payout)
$$
</Formula>

<Formula className="text-md">
$$
\text{ where }
\\R \text{ is the Reinfrocement of a Condition, }
\\sum(bets) \text{ is the sum of bets on all outcomes of a Conidition, }
\\max(payout) \text{ is the maximum potential payout to players for a Condition. }
$$
</Formula>

The main distinctive feature of Virtual Funds is that, despite their size incorporating the
[Reinforcement](/concepts/protocol/reinforcement) size designated at the creation of the Condition, the Reinforcement is
not locked on the [LP](/contracts/lp) balance fully.
Until the Condition is completed, only the liquidity amount needed to cover the maximum possible payout for
the Condition through user bets is locked on the LP balance. The locked liquidity value is recalculated each time a user
places a bet or a Data Provider provides Condition results. Thanks to this, the sum of Reinforcement amounts for all
current Conditions may exceed the liquidity amount on the LP balance. If the Reinforcement limit has not been reached
yet, but there is insufficient unlocked liquidity on the pool to support a bet, then that bet simply will not be accepted.
This mechanism efficiently utilizes liquidity and sustains a large number of Conditions in the game at any given moment.

The total volume of Virtual Funds does not always match the real fund of the Condition. When a player places
a bet, the ratio of Virtual Funds changes. Before calculating the odds on which the bet will be accepted, the
Virtual Fund of the outcome i on which the bet is placed increases by the size of the bet:

<Formula>
$$
F_{i}=F_{i}-a,\text{where } a \text{ is a bet amount. }
$$
</Formula>

After the bet on outcome i has been accepted, the Virtual Fund of other outcomes changes as follows:

<Formula>
$$
F_{j \neq i}\mathrel{{-}{=}}\frac{(payout-a)*F_{j}}{sum(F)},\text{where } a \text{ is a bet amount. }
$$
</Formula>

Thanks to the adjustment of Virtual Funds, in the absence of Data Provider control, an internal
mechanism of an automatic market maker of the betting odds is performed: the greater the volume of bets on an outcome,
the lower its odds, and the odds for other outcomes increase.

Also, due to this mechanism, the overall loss for the Condition in the worst-case scenario cannot exceed the size of
the reinforcement allocated by the Data Provider when creating the Condition.
