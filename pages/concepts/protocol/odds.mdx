Odds represent the probability of a particular outcome in a Condition actually happening. The odds for each outcome of
a [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions) are determined as the ratio of the total Condition funds to the funds of
that particular outcome.

The higher the odds, the lower the chances of the outcome happening and the higher the potential payout for the player
who placed a bet on that outcome. Betting odds are used by the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools) to manage the risk and
set payout rates for different bets.

The calculation of the odds is based on the virtual funds of the Condition and its margin.
Once the Condition is created, initial reinforcement is distributed proportionally among the outcome virtual funds based
on their initial odds provided by the [data provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers). When a bettor places a bet,
the outcome virtual fund on which they bet increases by the amount of the bet, and the net odds are calculated using
the following formula:

<Formula>
$$
  o_{i}=\frac{F_{0} + F_{1}} {F_{i}},\text{where } F_i \text{ is a virtual fund of the outcome } i
$$
</Formula>

Also the betting odds are adjusted according to the profit margin size set when creating the Condition. In order for
the bookmaker to make a profit, the final odds are decreased by the size of the outcome **spread**, which is calculated
based on the probability of the outcome and the profit margin. The probability of the outcome is calculated as the
reciprocal of the net odds of the outcome:

<Formula>
$$
  p_{i}=\frac{1}{o_i}=\frac{F_i} {F_0+F_1}\text{, where } F_i \text{ is a virtual fund of the outcome } i
$$
</Formula>

The size of the outcome spread is proportional to the size of the profit margin and inversely proportional to the
probability of the outcome. The spread for odds is calculated in such a way that the following conditions are met:

<Formula>
$$
  \frac{s_{1}}{s_{0}} = \frac{p_{0}}{p_{1}}
$$
</Formula>

<Formula>
$$
  \forall i :s_{i} = 1 - p_{i} o_{i}
$$
</Formula>

<Formula>
$$
  \\1 - \frac{1}{\sum\frac{1}{o_{i}}}=margin
$$
</Formula>

<Formula className="text-md">
$$
  \text{ where }
  \\s_i \text{ is a spread of the outcome } i,
  \\p_i \text{ is a probability of the outcome } i,
  \\o_i \text{ is an odds of the outcome i with applied spread } s_i
$$
</Formula>

To find the spreads that satisfy the conditions described above, it is necessary to solve a system of differential
equations, which is not feasible within the framework of EVM smart contracts. Therefore, the spread is calculated using
a special formula that approximates it with some degree of error.

The payout size for a bet on outcome i in the event of its winning is calculated as follows:

<Formula>
$$
  payout=o_i * (1-s_i)*a, \text{where } a \text{ is a bet amount}
$$
</Formula>

After the bet has been accepted, the virtual fund of the other outcome changes as follows:

<Formula>
$$
  F_{1-i}\mathrel{{-}{=}}payout-a,\text{where } a \text{ is a bet amount}
$$
</Formula>

Thus, automatic market making of the betting odds is performed. However, data provider also has the ability to change
the odds of each outcome at any time by passing desired values to a special method, thereby setting the desired odds
for accepting the next bets on the Condition.
