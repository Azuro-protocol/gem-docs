# AzuroGames

Casino and chance-based games have always been complementary to the main betting lines of sports, politics, asset prices, and other exotic markets.

AzuroGames represents Azuro’s auxiliary offering, enabling apps to include games-of-chance markets into its suite of betting lines. Gaming markets will still inherit liquidity from the singleton LP, and new data providers (separate to Azuro’s prediction markets) will be onboarded to price these gaming markets.

We aim to employ zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity of a data provider’s offchain randomizer process. Only simulations with a verifiable proof will be accepted as a valid outcome by Azuro’s onchain contracts, giving players the peace-of-mind that games are indeed executed in accordance to its pre-disclosed rules and algorithm set.
