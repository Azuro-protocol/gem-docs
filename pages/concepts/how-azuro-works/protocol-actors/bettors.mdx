# Bettors (Players)

Bets on Azuro are non-custodial — you interact directly with smart contracts.

Bettors can access Azuro markets via websites, interfaces, or widgets (known as "Apps") that connect to Azuro to deliver services to end-users.

Bettors play an important role towards the functioning of Azuro prediction markets. Profit-motivated bettors seek out mispricings of sell-side odds (pushed by the Data Provider) across Azuro prediction markets, and place bets against it — adjusting onchain odds back to market equilibrium in the process.

Betting volume is what drives accurate probabilities of prediction markets — no bettors, no volume, no functioning prediction market.

  When accessing markets supported by Azuro, players do not need to make deposits or withdrawals. Although the UX/UI on
  frontends is not overseen by Azuro - the intended use of Azuro's markets is such that players' funds and winnings can
  remain in their possession at all times. Such is the case when each prediction is a transaction with the smart-contract.
  Once the game finishes players just need to claim their winnings from the smart contract (if their prediction won).
