# Apps (Frontends)

Apps can be interfaces, widgets, tools, integrations or even standalone products that connects to the protocol and has a UI for users to interact with. While some apps can copy exisiting products and create new interfaces with localized and/or specialized features, sophisticated developers can go further and create new products altogether, building new pools and other overlays on top of the protocol’s suite of smart contracts.

In the case of [bookmaker.XYZ](https://bookmaker.xyz/) (a betting interface), the app instantly inherits all markets (with its underlying liquidity) that are hosted via Azuro smart contracts, and may simply focus on user acquisition and UI/UX improvements.

Apps [earn a % of the profits](https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/how-azuro-works/protocol-actors/rewards) realized by the [Pools](https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/how-azuro-works/components/pools) (from the part associated with their own users' activity). Apps will provide their addresses to allow the protocol to link it with their users' bets, allowing the [LP contract](https://gem.azuro.org/contracts/lp) to distribute part of generated protocol revenue to the given address.

Apps have the ability to choose which markets to display on their app. They can select from the list of supported conditions live on the protocol and remove events that are not needed.

<Callout type="warning">
AzuroDAO encourages apps to comply with any laws applicable to the jurisdictions they’re under. We expressly disclaim any liability in relation to the activities of any app connected to the protocol, as we have no control over the operations of said apps.
