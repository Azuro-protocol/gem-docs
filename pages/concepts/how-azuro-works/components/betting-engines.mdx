# Prediction Engines

A Prediction Engine (aka Betting Engine) is a collective term for contracts that encompass the logic of creating [Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions),
accepting bets, computing payouts for bets, and calculating [Affiliate](/concepts/basic/affiliates) [rewards](/concepts/basic/rewards).

These contracts are plugged into the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools) by its owner via the [Factory](/contracts/factory),
and access to place bets and withdraw payouts is only granted through the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract for which it was deployed.

A Betting Engine can inherit the [CoreBase](/contracts/core-base) contract that contains the fundamental logic to facilitate the betting
process on multi-outcome Conditions. At present, the Azuro project includes two Betting Engines: [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core)
for pre-match betting, which is based on the CoreBase contract, and [BetExpress](/contracts/bet-express) for
combo bets.
