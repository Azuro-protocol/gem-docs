# Pools

A Pool is a system of smart contracts that forms a unified betting platform. Anyone can deploy their own Pool on the
network using the [Factory](/contracts/factory) contract.

Each Pool includes the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract, which serves as the main entry point for the Pool's logic and is
responsible for managing the Pool's liquidity, and the [Access](/contracts/access) contract, which enables the Pool's
owner to have easy access control over functions of the Pool's contracts.

The Pool owner can plug in an unlimited number of [Betting Engines](/concepts/how-azuro-works/components/betting-engines) that encompass
the logic of creating [Conditions](/concepts/how-azuro-works/components/conditions), accepting bets, computing payouts for bets, and
calculating [app rewards](/concepts/how-azuro-works/rewards).
