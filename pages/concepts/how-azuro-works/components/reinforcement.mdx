# Reinforcement

Reinforcement is the initial liquidity amount that is distributed among outcomes of a [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions)
in accordance with the betting odds. It is set at the time of Condition creation and cannot be changed later.

It is used to ensure potential payouts for bets where the funds received from other bets on the Condition are insufficient.
Therefore, the reinforcement value also represents the maximum potential loss that the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)
can incur due to the Condition.
