# The Azuro Waves

<Callout type="feature">
Also referred to as “Community Airdrop 2”
</Callout>

- The distribution of $AZUR will come in Waves and will be 100% linear towards the points accrued by each address.
- The Waves program introduces “Levels” which give point multipliers. This means that all points earned by the eligible activities (which will be 100% transparent), will be multiplied by the level in the Wave which you have.
- Conditions for next waves may change but changes will never be retroactive. There will always be clarity about how points work and how $AZUR will be distributed from the beginning of each Wave.
- Wave 1 will start shortly after TGE.

<Callout type="feature">
You can already get the Bright Level (which gives 1.4x multiplier for Wave 1) by [staking your tokens before TGE](https://azuro.org/app/staking)! This means that you will start from that level and cannot lose it until the end of the Wave. You can only get higher from there.
</Callout>

<Callout type="feature">
TGE is expected between 17th and 22nd of June. Once TGE happens you will not be able to get your level this way anymore. Exact TGE date will not be announced in advance.
