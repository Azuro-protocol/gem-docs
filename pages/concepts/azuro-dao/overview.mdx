# Governance

The Azuro DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that governs the [Azuro Protocol](/concepts/the-azuro-protocol).
In contracts infrastructure, the Azuro DAO is the owner of the [Factory](/contracts/factory) contract to which a part
of the profit share is credited by [LP](/contracts/lp) after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions).
Azuro DAO is also responsible for providing correct Condition results through [SafeOracle](/contracts/safe-oracle)
if the data provider did not provide the result or if it was found to be incorrect by disputant.

---

Currently, the Azuro DAO is in phase 1, where the members are early contributors to the project. As Azuro develops
the voting procedure will change.

<Callout type="feature">
  The next version of the DAO will come into force after the launch of an **$AZUR** token
  and will be for Azuro token holders only.
</Callout>

Azuro is meant to become critical infrastructure for decentralized predictions and gaming. We hope that the decentralized
ownership and governance of this powerful infrastructure will not only lead to great benefits for its operators, but
to a fairer and more fun predictions world for the players.

A functional and fair Azuro DAO can foster not only an immensely profitable economy, but a reputation for enforcing
transparency & trust in online predictions.
