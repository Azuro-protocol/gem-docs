## How to earn Azuro Score points?

### Bet using frontend dApps
(find them on https://azuro.org/ecosystem)

| Condition | Score |
|---|---|
| For users with Azuro Score \<=100,000 | $ amount of the bet * odds of the bet * 10 |
| for users with Azuro Score \>100,000 | $ amount of the bet * odds of the bet * 5 |

<Callout type="info">
  - Example: a user with Azuro Score less than 100,000 makes a bet of $10 at odds of 3 (European odds used for the example). Points are calculated like this: **10 * 3 * 10 = 300 points**
  - All bets count. For combo bets - the final odds of the combo are used for the multiplier.
  - The max odds mutiplier is 10. I.e. if the odds of the bet or combo are above 10, then they are counted as 10 for the Azuro Score multiplier.

### Provide liquidity

**1 USDT/XDAI liquidity for 1 increment of time = 1.5 points** (i.e. \$1 liquidity provided for 2 increments
(at least 20 days) = 3 points; $1 liquidity provided for 35 days = 4.5 points; and so on…)

<Callout type="info">
  - 1 increment of time is 10 days. Only full increments count.
  - There is no restrictions on adding/withdrawing liquidity. The points are calculated according to the total amount of time liquidity has been provided for.
  - Score points are updated/attributed once per day at midnight UTC.
