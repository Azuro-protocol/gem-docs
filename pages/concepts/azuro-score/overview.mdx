## How to earn Azuro Score points?

### Bet using frontend dApps
(find them on https://azuro.org/ecosystem)

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{l}
&\text{Score} = \$ \text{ amount of the bet} \times \text{ odds of the bet} \times 5 \
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

<Callout type="info">
  - Example: a user makes a bet of $10 at odds of 3 (European odds used for the example). Points are calculated like this: **10 * 3 * 5 = 150 points**
  - All bets count. For combo bets - the final odds of the combo are used for the multiplier.
  - The max odds mutiplier is 10. I.e. if the odds of the bet or combo are above 10, then they are counted as 10 for the Azuro Score multiplier.
  - For previous settings check [here](https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/azuro-score/historical-data).

### Provide liquidity

**1 USDT/XDAI liquidity for 1 increment of time = 1.05 points** (i.e. \$1 liquidity provided for 2 increments
(at least 14 days) = 2.1 points; and so onâ€¦)

<Callout type="info">
  - 1 increment of time is 7 days. Only full increments count.
  - There is no restrictions on adding/withdrawing liquidity. The points are calculated according to the total amount of time liquidity has been provided for.
  - Score points are updated/attributed once per day at midnight UTC.
