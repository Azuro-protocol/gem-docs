## How to earn Azuro Score points?

### Bet using frontend dApps like https://bookmaker.XYZ 

|for users with Azuro Score <10,000| 
**$1 bet = 10 points **

|for users with Azuro Score between 10,000 and 20,000| 
**$1 bet = between 10 points and 1 point according to this formula: 
(1-sqrt(Azuro Score/10000-1))*9+1

|for users with Azuro Score >20,000|
**$1 bet = 1 point **

<Callout type="info">

### Providing liquidity

**1 USDC/XDAI liquidity for 1 increment of time = 0.3 points** (i.e. $1 liquidity provided for 2 increments
(at least 20 days) = 0.6 points; $1 liquidity provided for 35 days = 0.9 points; and so onâ€¦)

<Callout type="info">
  - 1 increment of time is 10 days. Only full increments count.
  - There is no restrictions on adding/withdrawing liquidity. The points are calculated according to the total amount of time liquidity has been provided for.
  - Only liquidity providers (addresses) adding liquidity after Feb 15, 00:01 UTC, 2023 (when Azuro pools were opened to the public) can receive points. If the LP (address) was LPing before this point in time (i.e. private liquidity) - it is excluded from Azuro Score points.
  - Score points are updated/attributed once per day at midnight UTC.
