# Placing Your First Onchain Bet

Important to note that when it comes to betting, Azuro is not a platform for users — it is a protocol for end-user applications. Depending on how each app integrates Azuro, it's likely that there will be no “deposits” or “withdrawals” akin to traditional betting sites. In most cases, bettors will place bets by interacting with Azuro smart contracts (facilitated by a third-party app) — authorization of said bets must come from each bettor's own private key.

Each Azuro-powered app has their own distinct interface style and user experience flows. However, since Azuro is an EVM-based protocol, on many of these apps you may need an EVM-compatible wallet to interact with Azuro smart contracts (which includes placing and redeeming bets). Sample EVM wallets: [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/), [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/).

Some apps offer social-based authentication, in which bettors can create a wallet via social accounts like Google, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, or X/Twitter. Check with each app for specific implementations.

Although Azuro is non-custodial by nature, some apps may choose to operate under a custodial model mainly for abstraction and user onboarding reasons. Apps built as a Telegram bot, or apps part of a wider custodial ecosystem, would be such examples.
