# Azuro Waves

<Callout type="feature">
The Azuro Waves program is the successor to [Azuro Score](/knowledge-hub/airdrops/azuro-score/overview).
</Callout>

## Overview

- The distribution of $AZUR will come in Waves and will be 100% linear towards the points accrued by each address.
- The Waves program introduces “Levels” which give point multipliers. This means that all points earned by the eligible activities (which will be 100% transparent), will be multiplied by the level in the Wave which you have.
- Conditions for next waves may change but changes will never be retroactive. There will always be clarity about how points work and how $AZUR will be distributed from the beginning of each Wave.

**Wave 2 is currently ongoing. Click [here](/knowledge-hub/airdrops/azuro-waves/wave2) for more information on the program.**
