Level multiplier offer an additional incentive for Azuro's most loyal and active users. Your weekly points will be multiplied by the multiplier associated with your acquired level at that week. The higher your acquired level, the higher your multiplier!

Upon the conclusion of each Wave period, your acquired level will move down one tier for the next Wave. For example, if you have the Ultramarine level at the end of Wave 1, then you will start from the Blue level for Wave 2.

<Callout type="warning">
If you do not see your level in the Waves tab in the Azuro App, make sure to click the ENHANCE button. You can do this at any stage within the Wave.
However, if you never do it and the Wave ends - you will not have any Level Multiplier points.
