## Points rules

| Activity | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| [Placing Bets](https://azuro.org/ecosystem) | Х points =  \{Bet sum\} * min( \{Odds\}; 10) / 5<br />e.g. 1 point = \$2.5 bet at odds of 2 (European odds format) |
| [Liquidity Provision](https://azuro.org/app/liquidity) | Discontinued |
| [DEX LP'ing](https://azuro.org/app/dex-farming) | Discontinued |
| [\$AZUR Staking](https://azuro.org/app/staking)<br />(excl. unbonding) | 1 point = 1 000 AZUR staked/day |
| Ecosystem support activities | Ad-hoc. To be announced separately whenever such rewards are to become available. |

All points are credited once a day. A minimum holding period of 24 hours is required for the deposits to qualify for the points.

Points awarded for betting activity will be credited after 100-300 blocks from the time the bet was placed. All bets placed during the Wave period will be included, even if their outcome and resolve date occurs after the end of the Wave period.

## Points multipliers

### Levels multiplier

| Level ID | Level name | Level multiplier | Points needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Mist |  | 0 |
| 1 | Sky | x1.1 | 100 |
| 2 | Blue | x1.2 | 200 |
| 3 | Ultramarine | x1.3 | 500 |
| 4 | Bright | x1.4 | 1 200 |
| 5 | Brilliant | x1.6 | 2 500 |
| 6 | Royal | x2 | 6 000 |

In Wave #2, points that count towards levels multiplier can only be earned from AZUR staking. To illustrate, if you have 650 points from AZUR staking and 5 000 points from betting activities, your levels multiplier will be Ultramarine (x1.3).

Your weekly points will be multiplied by the multiplier associated with your acquired level at that week. The higher your acquired level, the higher your multiplier!

Upon the conclusion of each Wave period, your acquired level will move down one tier for the next Wave. For example, if you have the Ultramarine level at the end of Wave 1, then you will start from the Blue level for Wave 2.

<Callout type="warning">
If you do not see your level in the Waves tab in the Azuro App, make sure to click the ENHANCE button. You can do this at any stage within the Wave.
However, if you never do it and the Wave ends - you will not have any Level Multiplier points.

### Leaderboard multiplier

Making it into the weekly leaderboard gives you point multipliers (applicable to the points you generate in that particular week).

| 1-10 | 2x |
| 11-50 | 1.7x |
| 51-500 | 1.4x |
