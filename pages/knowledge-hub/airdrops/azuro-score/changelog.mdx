### Change effective since Apr 8, 2024:

From Apr 8, 2024, 00:01 UTC onwards, the 3x liquidity provision rule that existed from Nov 10, 2023, does not apply anymore. 

<Callout type="info">
 The 3x rule stated that liquidity added to the Polygon USDT pool earns 3x the Azuro Score points (i.e. 3 * 1.05=3.15). Does not apply since Apr 8, 2024.

Bet using frontend dApps
(find them on https://azuro.org/ecosystem)

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{l}
&\text{Score} = \$ \text{ amount of the bet} \times \text{ odds of the bet} \times 5 \
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

<Callout type="info">
  - Example: a user makes a bet of $10 at odds of 3 (European odds used for the example). Points are calculated like this: **10 * 3 * 5 = 150 points**
  - All bets count. For combo bets - the final odds of the combo are used for the multiplier.
  - The max odds mutiplier is 10. I.e. if the odds of the bet or combo are above 10, then they are counted as 10 for the Azuro Score multiplier.
  - For previous settings check [here](https://gem.azuro.org/knowledge-hub/azuro-score/historical-data).
