## Uniswap DEX LP

<Callout type="warning">
This program has been discontinued.

By participating in the DEX LP Incentives program, you can earn rewards distributed over a 90-day period.

**Starting at TGE**: 6,000,000 tokens will be allocated over 90 days.

**Distribution Rate**: Equal distribution block by block, resulting in 66,667 tokens per day or 2,778 tokens per hour.

<Callout type="info">
Your share of the AZUR reward from each block depends on the value and range of your LP position. You do not receive any DEX Farming rewards when the AZUR price is outside your LP position range:

**Narrow Range**: Concentrating your AZUR-WETH liquidity in a narrow price range can significantly boost your rewards. The smaller the range, the higher your reward share, providing an excellent opportunity for increased returns when the AZUR price remains within your chosen range.

**Wider Range**: Spreading your liquidity over a wider range offers more stability and consistent rewards. Covering a broader range ensures that a significant portion of your liquidity is always active in trades, leading to steady returns while still participating in the reward distribution.
