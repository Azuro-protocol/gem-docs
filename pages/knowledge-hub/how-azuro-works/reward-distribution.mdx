# Reward Distribution

The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the fee of the [Pool's](https://gem.azuro.org/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools) profit that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each entitled to rewards from protocol revenue: Liquidity Providers (LPs), Data Providers, Apps, and AzuroDAO.

## LPs and Data Providers

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (20% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.

## Apps (Frontends)

Apps' reward is paid monthly, separately for each chain.

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\textit{AppReward} = 70\% \times \textit{AppRevenue} \\
\textit{SpreadRewardCap} = 50\% \times \textit{Spread} \times \textit{BetSize} \\
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{where} \\
\textit{AppReward} \text{ is not higher than } \textit{SpreadRewardCap}, \\
\textit{Spread} \text{ is the vig (aka margin) for each particular bet,} \\
\textit{BetSize} \text{ is the amount (aka wagered cryptocurrency) of each particular bet.}
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>


### DAO

The DAO reward being a license fee for the Azuro protocol solution is calculated by deducting all other rewards from the total monthly Pool Revenue.
