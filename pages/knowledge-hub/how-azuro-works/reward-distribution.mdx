# Reward Distribution

The term "reward" within Azuro protocol refers to the part of the [Pool's](https://gem.azuro.org/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools) profit that is distributed to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are 4 types of contributors in the Pool, each entitled to rewards from protocol revenue: Liquidity Providers (LPs), Data Providers, Apps, and AzuroDAO.

Note that reward split percentages aren't set in stone, and may be subject to further changes if deemed necessary by AzuroDAO.

## LPs and Data Providers

For LPs and Data Providers, after the completion of each [Condition](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/conditions), the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the reward rate (20% and 10% respectively) and added to the contributor reward balance.

## Apps (Frontends)

<Callout type="info">
Visit [this](https://dune.com/queries/4361346/7319176) Dune query to view the historical month-by-month of our apps' reward calculation.
</Callout>

Apps' reward is paid monthly, separately for each chain. Each app's final take-home reward (aka. revenue share) will be the lower of its *RevenueReward* and its *SpreadRewardCap (SRCt)* for that month.

### SpreadRewardCap (SRCt)

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\textit{SRCb} = 50\% \times \textit{Spread} \times \textit{BetSize} \\
\textit{SRCt} = \textit{SRCb1} + \textit{SRCb2} + ... + \textit{SRCbi} \\
\\
\\
\text{where} \\
\textit{SRC} \text{ denotes } \textit{SpreadRewardCap}, \\
\textit{SRCb} \text{ represents the } \textit{SpreadRewardCap} \text{ for an individual bet}, \\
\textit{SRCt} \text{ represents the sum of } \textit{SRCb} \text{ over a month's period}, \\
\\
\text{and} \\
\textit{Spread} \text{ is the vig (aka margin) for an individual bet,} \\
\textit{BetSize} \text{ is the amount (aka wager size) of an individual bet.}
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

### RevenueReward

<Formula>
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\textit{RevenueReward} = 70\% \times \textit{AppRevenue} \\
\\
\\
\text{where} \\
\textit{AppRevenue} \text{ is the protocol revenue that is attributed to a particular app}, \\
\textit{RevenueReward} \text{ is the notional reward for a particular app before applying } \textit{SRCt}.
\end{array}
$$
</Formula>

## DAO

The remaining amount will be attributable to AzuroDAO, calculated by deducting all other rewards from the total monthly Pool Revenue.

<Callout type="info">
LP, Data Provider, and DAO rewards can happen to be negative in the event of Pool losses (caused by bettor outperformance). However, App rewards can be only positive or zero.
