# Bettors (Players)

Bettors can access Azuro markets via websites, interfaces, or widgets (aka apps) that connect to Azuro to deliver services to end-users.

When accessing markets supported by Azuro, players *typically* do not need to make deposits or withdrawals (with the exception of custodial apps). The intended use of Azuro's markets is such that players' funds and winnings can remain in their possession at all times â€“ each bet is a transaction that interacts directly with Azuro smart contracts. Once the game finishes players just need to claim their winnings from the smart contract (if bets are won).

<Callout type="warning">
Do note that apps connected to the protocol are distinct and separate entities from AzuroDAO. We cannot be held responsible for the loss of funds arising from interacting with malicious wallets, websites, apps, or interfaces. Bettors are encouraged to DYOR!

Bettors play an important role towards the functioning of Azuro prediction markets. Profit-motivated bettors seek out mispricings of sell-side odds (pushed by the [Data Provider](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/protocol-actors/data-providers)) across Azuro prediction markets and place bets against it, adjusting onchain odds back to its free market equilibrium.
