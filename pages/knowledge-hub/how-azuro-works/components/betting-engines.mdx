# Betting Engines

A Betting Engine is a collective term for contracts that encompass the logic of creating [Conditions](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/conditions),
accepting bets, computing payouts for bets, and calculating [app rewards](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/rewards).

These contracts are plugged into the [Pool](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools) by its owner via the [Factory](/contracts/factory),
and access to place bets and withdraw payouts is only granted through the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract for which it was deployed.

A Betting Engine can inherit the [CoreBase](/contracts/core-base) contract that contains the fundamental logic to facilitate the betting
process on multi-outcome Conditions. At present, the Azuro project includes two Betting Engines: [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core)
for pre-match betting, which is based on the CoreBase contract, and [BetExpress](/contracts/bet-express) for
combo bets.
