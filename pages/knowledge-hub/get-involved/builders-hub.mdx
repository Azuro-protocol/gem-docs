# Builders' Hub

Azuro’s Builders’ Hub is the all-in-one dashboard for prospective developers to view, propose, and contribute to the Azuro project.

Participate in Azuro events, check out open RFDs (Request for Developments), and stay on top of bug bounty programs and competitions!

Developers are the lifeblood to every thriving protocol — we embody open-source values and recognize the power of rockstar teams building daring projects in public. The Builders’ Hub form our initiative to encourage, support, and reward builders for their contributions to Azuro.
