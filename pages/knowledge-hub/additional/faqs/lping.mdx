# LP'ing

## I want to LP. Wat do?

Head over to [Azuro Portal](http://app.azuro.org/). Find your preferred pool (split by token and chain). Click deposit.

## How is the displayed APY calculated?

It is based on the pool’s historical performance. This is why you’ll see different pools showing different yields, as it is dependent on the pool’s own supplied amount of liquidity as well as the performance of bettors where the pool is the counterparty.

Past performance doesn’t indicate future results.

## Why is my LP position showing negative?

All new deposits experience an initial negative skew. This is to counteract attempts to game the system. Most LP positions return a positive yield within a month’s time.

However, there’s a non-zero likelihood that the pool could experience extended bettor performance, which may prolong the time of which your position will be in the red.

Although withdrawals can be made at any point past the initial 7-day lock period, we recommend depositing liquidity to the LP only if you have a long time horizon (more than 3 months). We cannot guarantee profitability on your LP position — DYOR and ape responsibly!
