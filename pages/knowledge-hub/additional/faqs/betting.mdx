# Betting

## I want to bet. Wat do?

Go to the Azuro [app page](https://azuro.org/ecosystem). Find your preferred app, visit their interface, and bet!

## I don’t have crypto. Wat do?

Onramp via reputable CEXs like Binance or Coinbase. Else, you can onramp directly via Metamask, or through fiat onramp partners of the app that you’ve chosen.
Some apps support social-based authentication (login with Google / Facebook / etc.) as well as gasless transactions (no gas token required to place bets). Check with respective apps for specific implementation and user flow guide.

## I won my bet. How to redeem?

All bets on Azuro are direct interactions with the smart contract. The app that you’re using should have a button for you to click and redeem your winnings. You will be initiating a smart contract transaction on click, which you should authorize to redeem your winnings.

## Bets take forever to resolve. Am I doomed?

On average, Azuro bets resolve within two hours of the event’s end time. If it’s been two hours since the event ended and your bets have not resolved, raise the issue on our Discord.

Data providers manage a lot of markets, so there might be times when their infrastructure can’t keep up with the load (especially considering the early stages of the Azuro project). But rest assured, your funds are safe — they are locked on smart contracts, not held by the data provider nor any other entity.
