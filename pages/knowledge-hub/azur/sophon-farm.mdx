# Sophon Farm

Starting 22nd of August, 2024, AZUR stakers can utilize their stAZUR tokens on Sophon's platform to farm Sophon Points (SP). These points will be converted to SOPH tokens once the Sophon Mainnet goes live and they launch the SOPH token.

Staking stAZUR with Sophon allows you to earn double rewards, since staking stAZUR with Sophon is equivalent to holding stAZUR in your wallet.

### How to Farm SP

1. To earn stAZUR, stake your $AZUR in the [AZUR Staking](https://azuro.org/app/staking) section in the Azuro Portal.
