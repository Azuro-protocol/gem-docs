# pAZUR

**pAZUR** is a non-fungible token (NFT, ERC-721) issued when a user locks **stAZUR** for a fixed period of **2 years**. Holding a pAZUR makes the holder eligible to receive a proportional share of **onchain revenue distributions** denominated in **USDT**, funded by real protocol usage on Azuro.

This mechanism introduces a long-term alignment layer to the Azuro ecosystem. pAZUR is designed for users who are committed to Azuroâ€™s growth and are willing to lock their tokens in return for exposure to protocol-driven revenue flow. It is not an investment product and carries no guarantees of returns.

## How pAZUR Works

1. **User action:** Lock **AZUR** for pAZUR
2. **Under the hood:**
    - AZUR is staked â†’ becomes **stAZUR**
    - stAZUR is immediately locked for 2 years
    - A unique **pAZUR NFT** is minted
2. **Holder of pAZUR** is eligible to claim a share of USDT revenue over time

This process is presented as a **single, unified step** in the user interface. No manual staking or intermediate steps are required from the user.

## NFT Structure (Per pAZUR)

Each NFT stores immutable parameters:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lockedAmount | uint256 | Amount of stAZUR locked |
| lockedAt | uint256 (timestamp) | Lock creation time |
| unlocksAt | uint256 (timestamp) | Lock end time (exactly 2 years later) |
| claimedUSDT | uint256 | USDT already claimed by this NFT (optional field) |

## Revenue Distribution

- Rewards are streamed in **USDT** and distributed proportionally to all active pAZUR NFTs.
- Revenue comes from **real protocol activity** (e.g. betting fees, liquidity usage).
- There is **no fixed APR** and **no guarantee of future revenue**.
- Weekly distribution volume may vary based on protocol performance.
- All distributions are claimable by the **current holder** of each NFT.

## Example (Illustrative)

- You lock **100,000 AZUR** through the interface
- Internally, this becomes **100,000 stAZUR**, immediately locked
- A pAZUR NFT is minted:
    - lockedAmount = 100,000
    - lockedAt = 2025-07-01
    - unlocksAt = 2027-07-01
- If total locked = 10,000,000 and weekly pool = $6,500 â†’ You may claim **65 USDT**

## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- **Lock is final** â€” stAZUR cannot be withdrawn before unlock date
- **stAZUR must originate from Ethereum** â€” Base or other chains are not supported for pAZUR
- **pAZUR is transferable**, and all claim rights follow the NFT
- **No guarantee of income** â€” distributions depend entirely on protocol revenue
- **pAZUR is not a financial product** and should not be treated as an investment
