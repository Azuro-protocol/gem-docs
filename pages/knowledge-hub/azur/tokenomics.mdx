### Ecosystem & Community Incentives

37.5% of AZUR is allocated towards the benefit of the Azuro ecosystem and community.

92M AZUR (9.2% of the total supply) is unlocked at the TGE. The rest of the allocation includes the 3% Azuro Score airdrop vesting linearly over 6 months, while 25.3% has a 6-month lockup, after which it unlocks linearly over next 42 months. It will be primarily used to incentivize community-centric campaigns: the Azuro Waves program, developer grants, and other forms of incentive schemes.
