# AzuroDAO

AzuroDAO is the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization, with the mandate of safeguarding smart contract functions and ensuring the protocol’s continual going-concern. In contracts infrastructure, AzuroDAO is the owner of the Factory contract to which a part of the profit share is credited by LP after the completion of each Condition.

In the context of Azuro prediction markets, AzuroDAO plays a critical role of being the arbiter of last resort for disputed event resolutions, as well as to elect qualified data providers into the set. Decisions are congregated and made via onchain voting, where voting power corresponds the amount of staked AZUR and staking duration, specified under [redacted].

As the project scales to steady-state, expect more features to be enshrined into the protocol. AzuroDAO will form the governance backbone of all these features — exact specifications to be disclosed closer to each feature’s release.

The Schelling point token of AzuroDAO will always be AZUR. There will not be another token for the protocol — in the past, present, or future.
