# stAZUR

Staking AZUR signals your commitment to Azuro. By staking AZUR, youâ€™ll be eligible to earn staking yield.

<Callout type="feature">
Staking rewards are a form of real yield, and are not derived off new emissions from the uncirculated AZUR supply.
</Callout>

When staking AZUR, users will receive stAZUR, our liquid staking token that can be used on partner platforms to gain additional rewards from our partners.

<Callout type="warning">
If you staked AZUR using the old contract, you'll continue earning rewards. To receive stAZUR, you must claim it in the [app](https://azuro.org/app/staking).
