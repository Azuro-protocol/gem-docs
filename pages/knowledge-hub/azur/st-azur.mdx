# stAZUR

Staking AZUR is an ongoing opportunity to align with the growth and success of the Azuro ecosystem. By staking AZUR, participants earn real yield generated directly from protocol activity, ensuring sustainable rewards without relying on emissions from the uncirculated supply. This approach reflects Azuro’s commitment to long-term value creation.

When you stake AZUR, you receive stAZUR, a non-rebasing liquid staking token that represents your stake and rewards. The fixed balance of stAZUR in your wallet provides predictability, while its underlying value grows over time to reflect accrued rewards. Beyond staking, stAZUR can also be utilized on partner platforms, offering additional earning opportunities and extending its utility.

The rewards pool, distributed over recurring campaigns, reflects the success and activity of the Azuro protocol. Rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake, incentivizing both substantial contributions and long-term engagement. This dynamic model ensures that participants continue to benefit from Azuro’s growth as the protocol evolves.
