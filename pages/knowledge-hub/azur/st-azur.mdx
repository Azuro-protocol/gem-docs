# stAZUR

<Callout type="feature">
The current staking campaign is ending soon. Read our [announcement](https://blog.azuro.org/azur-staking-the-distribution-46acf92dbb40) for more details.
</Callout>

Staking AZUR signals your commitment to Azuro. By staking AZUR, you’ll be eligible to earn *real* yield that is generated from protocol activity. Staking rewards are **never** derived off new emissions from the uncirculated AZUR supply.

When staking AZUR, users will receive stAZUR, our liquid staking token that can be used on partner platforms to gain additional rewards from our partners.

<Callout type="warning">
If you staked AZUR using the old contract, you'll continue earning rewards. To receive stAZUR, you must claim it in the [app](https://azuro.org/app/staking).
