# Use Freebets

To check whether a user has any freebets and obtain information about them, it's necessary to read events from the
blockchain since there's no direct way to get a list of freebets from the [Freebet](/contracts/free-bet) contract.
You can read more about the events on the ["Distribute Freebets"](/contracts/guides/distribute-freebets) page.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend caching the received data, it can be saved in a database for future use.
</Callout>

Once the data on all the freebets is obtained, you can determine the availability of free bets for a specific user.

To use a freebet, the user needs to call the `redeem` function.

To claim their winnings or refunds if the condition was canceled users should call the `withdrawPayout` function.
