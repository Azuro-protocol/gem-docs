# Distribute Freebets

First, deploy the [FreeBet](/contracts/free-bet) contract and specify the token. Bind the contract with the [LP](/contracts/lp)
and transfer liquidity to the deployed contract. Use `setManager` to add a manager who will manage freebets and withdrawals.
Use the `mint` or `mintBatch` function to distribute freebets.

### Provide Liquidity

The liquidity balance can be obtained by calling the `balanceOf(freebetAddress)` function on the token contract.

### List Freebets

Use the `FreeBetMinted` / `FreeBetMintedBatch` events to list the NFT IDs of the distributed freebets. To filter active
freebets, exclude those that have been redeemed, canceled, or withdrawn.

The freebet status is not stored on the contract but can be obtained from the events. There are four possible statuses:
`Created`, `Reissued`, `Redeemed`, and `Withdrawn`.

Users should call the `withdrawPayout` function to claim their winnings or refunds if the condition was canceled. The
`BettorWin` event indicates a user's bet has won, while the `FreeBetReissued` event is invoked if the condition was canceled.

### Withdraw Liquidity

Finally, to withdraw liquidity from the contract, call the `withdrawReserve(amount)` function. Only tokens that are
free from freebets can be withdrawn. To unlock reserved tokens, call the `resolveExpired` function when freebets expire.

Use the `lockedReserve` function on the freebet contract to determine the amount of locked tokens that cannot be withdrawn.

  We recommend limiting the IDs provided to the `resolveExpired` function parameters to avoid errors during transaction
  execution.
