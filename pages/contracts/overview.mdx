# Overview

The main infrastructure of the protocol is formed by the following smart contracts:

- [Factory](/contracts/factory). Contains functions for deploying [Pools](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools) and associated
Betting Engines. Owned by [Azuro DAO](/knowledge-hub/azur/azuro-dao).
- [LP](/contracts/lp). Serves as the main entry point for a Pool's logic. This contract contains all the core logic of
the Pool and the liquidity for providing bets. Owned by its creator.
- [Access](/contracts/access). Enables the Pool's owner to control access to the pool's contract functions.
Owned by the Pool's owner.
- [Betting Engines](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/betting-engines). Encompass the logic of creating [Conditions](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/conditions),
accepting bets, computing payouts for bets, and calculating [Rewards](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/reward-distribution). These contracts can
be connected to the Pool by its owner in an unlimited number. Owned by the Pool's owner.

Additional tools that do not affect the Pool's logic:

- [Freebet](/contracts/free-bet). A tool that enables granting freebets to any user.
- [SafeOracle](/contracts/safe-oracle). Azuro dispute resolution system for Condition results.
