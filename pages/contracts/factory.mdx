# Factory

The Factory contract contains functions for deploying [Pools](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools) and
[Betting Engines](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/betting-engines) associated with them. It stores the addresses of the BeaconProxy
contracts for [LP](/contracts/lp), [AzuroBet](/contracts/azuro-bet), [Access](/contracts/access) and all available types
of Betting Engines. The list of Betting Engines types available for deployment is determined by [Azuro DAO](/knowledge-hub/azur/azuro-dao),
and currently includes only the [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract, but soon it will be supplemented
by [BetExpress](/contracts/bet-express).

<Callout type="info">
  All contracts deployed via Factory belong to the account that deployed them. Only the pool owner has access to add
  new Betting Engines to the pool.
</Callout>

The process of creating a Pool involves deploying an LP contract responsible for the main pool's logic, along with an
Access contract that manages access policies to the LP and the associated Betting Engine contracts. When a Betting Engine
is plugged in, its contract instance is deployed, and if the contract logic permits it, an AzuroBet contract is
also deployed to manage the betting tokens on it.
