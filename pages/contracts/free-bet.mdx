The FreeBet contract allows you to provide a non-transferable ERC-721 token that allows the user to place a free bet
on any [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract. Each FreeBet token has a denomination, expiration time, and
minimum betting odds requirement. If the free bet wins, the bettor receives only the
difference between the winnings and the bet amount.

The minter of the FreeBet token pays for its denomination. The FreeBet contract takes care of everything related to
making the granted bet and withdrawing winnings from the [LP](/contracts/lp) on behalf of the user.
