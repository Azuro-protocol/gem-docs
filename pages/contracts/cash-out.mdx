</Callout>


The CashOut contract allows bettors to sell their [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core), [LiveCore](/contracts/live-client-core), or [BetExpress](contracts/bet-express) bet tokens before the outcome is determined.

The payout is calculated based on the bet size and the exchange odds provided by an oracle at the time of cash-out. A valid oracle signature is required to confirm the odds. Bets can only be cashed out while their outcome remains unknown.

Once a bet is successfully cashed out:
- Ownership of the bet token is transferred to the smart contract.
- The payout is credited from the contract to the bettorâ€™s balance.
