The BetExpress contract allows users to place express bets. The contract is linked to a specific deployed
[PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract and only takes information about the
[Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions) from it.

An unlimited number of sub-bets on different Conditions can be included in a single Express, but the maximum possible
winnings for one Condition in all bets should not exceed a predetermined amount. An Express cannot include sub-bets on
Conditions related to the same game, as in this case, the winnings of the sub-bets become
interdependent events. Express bets also affect the betting odds in the Conditions on which the bet is placed.

The winnings for an express bet can only be obtained after all Conditions included in it have been completed. If a
Condition included in an Express is canceled, the Express bet is still valid but the potential winnings will be adjusted
proportionally based on the betting odds of the canceled sub-bet. If all Conditions included in the Express are canceled,
the bettor can claim their bet back.
