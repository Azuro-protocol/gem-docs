The AzuroBet contract is an ERC-721 enumerable token that secures the right to receive a reward if the bet wins or
receive the bet back if the [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions) is canceled.

It is less complex and costly than a standard ERC-721 Enumerable contract because the [CoreBase](/contracts/core-base)
bet ID is incremental. Additionally, it provides additional view features such as obtaining the list of tokens owned by an address.

At the moment, this contract is only used in the [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract. Each PrematchCore
has its own AzuroBet contract deployed, and by and large, they can be considered a single functioning mechanism.
