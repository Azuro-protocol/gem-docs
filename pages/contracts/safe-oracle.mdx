The SafeOracle contract allows to create and resolve [Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions) on any
[PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract, with an option for any user to dispute the result. If the result is
disputed or not provided within the specified period set at the time of Condition creation,
[Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) will provide the result.

The SafeOracle's logic guarantees timely and accurate results for created Conditions or cancels them if the correct
result is impossible to determine. This eliminates the risk of fraud against bettors by the
[data provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers) and the possibility of their funds being locked due to the data
provider's failure to provide the result.

When creating a Condition through SafeOracle, the data provider places a fixed amount as collateral, which will be
returned to them if their result is timely and accurate. Otherwise, the collateral will be used as a reward for Azuro DAO
and optionally the disputant.

A dispute can be opened by a disputant only within a limited timeframe after the data providers result for the Condition.
After this period, the result will be accepted and executed on the LP contract. When opening a dispute,
the disputant also places a collateral, which is half of the data provider's collateral. If the DAO determines that
the result is incorrect, the disputant will double their collateral; otherwise, they will lose their funds.
