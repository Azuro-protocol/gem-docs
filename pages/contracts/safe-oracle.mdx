The SafeOracle contract allows data providers to create and resolve [Conditions](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/conditions) on any
[PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract, with an option for any user to dispute the result. If the result is
disputed or not provided within the specified period set at the time of Condition creation,
[AzuroDAO](/knowledge-hub/azur/azuro-dao) will step in to resolve the Condition.

The SafeOracle's logic guarantees timely and accurate results for created Conditions or cancels them if the correct
result is impossible to determine. This eliminates the risk of fraud against bettors by the
[data provider](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/protocol-actors/data-providers) and the possibility of their funds being locked due to the data
provider's failure to provide the result.

Each data provider will have a certain amount of fixed collateral placed to the protocol, depending on the amount of [Reinforcement](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/reinforcement) that they intend to draw upon from the singleton LP at any one time. This collateral doubles as slashable assets in the case of false resolutions, if deemed by AzuroDAO.

Each market's settlement will have a short delay post-resolution to allow for members of AzuroDAO to raise a dispute if necessary. Disputants will be required to place a small bond to deter griefing attacks to the protocol's dispute mechanism.

If the data provider's original resolution is determined to be accurate, the disputant will lose their bond to the data provider. Conversely, a portion of the data provider's collateral will be slashed and redistributed to the disputant, while the AzuroDAO resolves the market to the correct outcome and renounces the data provider's ownership of the associated [Pool](/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/components/pools ownership) (ejected from the set). Amount of slashed collateral will scale relative to the amount at risk of the disputed market.
