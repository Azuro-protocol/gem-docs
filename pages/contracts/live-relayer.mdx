# Relayer

"Relayer" contract is intended for execution of prepared and signed (by bettor and by oracle) bets, and payment of relayer's fee.
Any "relayer" can send prepared bets using the `Relayer.betFor()` method.
At bet execution, `LP.betFor()` is executed and the reward is sent to the performer.
