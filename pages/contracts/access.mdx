  The contracts have a separate open-source project that can be found [here](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Access).
</Callout>

The Access contract enables the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s owner to have easy access control over functions of
the Pool's contracts for all users. When a Pool is created, an Access contract is deployed to manage access control for
all other contracts within the Pool.

Function access is granted through ownership of an ERC-721 token, with each token representing an access role. A user
can hold multiple roles and gain access to allowed functions based on their roles. A contract function can be associated
with multiple roles simultaneously.

The contract supports up to 256 roles simultaneously for a single Pool, and also provides the option to assign a custom
name to each role for greater convenience of use.
