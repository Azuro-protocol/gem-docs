# LP

The LP contract serves as the main entry point for a [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s logic. Through it, the Pool owner
can enable or disable plugged [Betting Engines](/concepts/protocol/betting-engines), adjust
reinforcement limits and minimum bet amounts for each Betting Engine, manage games, and
change [fee](/concepts/basic/fees-and-rewards) shares for [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview),
[Data Provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers), and [Affiliates](/concepts/basic/affiliates). All operations
related to depositing or withdrawing funds, such as placing a new bet, receiving winnings, or receiving
DAO/Data Provider/Affiliate rewards, are performed through the LP contract.

The LP contract also contains a pool of liquidity for conditions reinforcement. Anyone can become a liquidity provider
by adding liquidity to the Pool and receive a share of its profits and losses (P&L). Liquidity tokens (LPNFTs) represent
the liquidity added by the user. LPNFTs can be redeemed partially or completely by the user at any time, with the user
receiving their share of the common liquidity, including P&L from the time of adding liquidity. All deposits are stored
in a special data structure called the Liquidity Tree, which provides a fair distribution of P&L among the deposits.
