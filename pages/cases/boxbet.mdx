### Lessons learned from the integration that could be valuable for other apps

Implementing Azuro's system necessitates substantial technical expertise. While the ongoing development of the SDK promises to simplify integration into a more user-friendly, one-click process for operators, the current state of integration demands careful planning and should not be hastened. It's essential to allocate sufficient time to ensure a smooth integration. Additionally, Azuro offers a compelling revenue-sharing model for front-end platforms. It's crucial to design your system with the capability to capitalize on this revenue share, optimizing your platform's financial benefits from partnering with Azuro.
