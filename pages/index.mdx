# Azuro Protocol

<p className="mt-6">Welcome to Azuro's documentation!</p>
<p>Azuro is building the foundation for decentralized betting markets by utilizing three of crypto's main primitives: Prediction Markets, NFTs, and DAO governance. Additionally, Azuro has developed a new Liquidity Pool design, the Liquidity Tree, which creates and maintains market liquidity.</p>
<p>The end result is a seamless betting experience with thousands of liquid markets, a rich feature set, and a user-friendly interface. Applications (also known as Frontends) built on top of Azuro offer users a viable, decentralized alternative to traditional online betting operators, providing full transparency and a commitment to responsibility.</p>
<p>Our vision is to create a rich and fun betting environment that is cost-effective for players, community-run, and transparent. By leveraging the latest in blockchain technology, Azuro is revolutionizing the world of online betting, providing a trustless and secure platform that empowers players and communities alike.</p>
