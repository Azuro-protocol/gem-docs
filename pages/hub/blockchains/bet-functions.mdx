## Placing bet and paying out

Placing a bet occurs in several stages:
- bettor approves token spending (for the bet) for the *Relayer contract* (entry point for bets)
- bettor forms the bet parameters and signs (using EIP-712 standard) it in the WEB3 wallet. *All betting is done, using the EIP-712 parameters signing*
- bettor transfers the signed data to the oracle via API
- oracle signs received data, forms and transfers the order to the executor (Relayer Executor)
- the executor (Relayer Executor) execute transaction call of `function betFor(OrderData[] orders)` method of *Relayer contract*, `orders` contains the user's bet data, placing the bet
```solidity
struct OrderData {
    address betOwner;
    ConditionData[] conditionDatas;
    BetType betType;
    address oracle;
    bytes clientBetData;
    bytes bettorSignature;
    bytes oracleSignature;
}

struct ConditionData {
    uint256 gameId;
    uint256 conditionId;
    ConditionKind conditionKind;
    uint64[] odds;
    uint128[] outcomes;
    uint128 potentialLossLimit;
    uint8 winningOutcomesCount;
}

enum BetType {
    ORDINARY,
    COMBO
}

enum ConditionKind {
    PREMATCH,
    LIVE
}
```
- after placing a bet (transaction executed), the `NewLiveBet()` event is emitted, and bettor receives a bet token (azurobet)
```solidity
event NewLiveBet(
    uint256 indexed tokenId,
    address indexed bettor,
    address indexed affiliate,
    BetType betType,
    uint256 nonce,
    uint128 amount,
    SubBetData[] betDatas, // one record for ordinary, many records for combo
    uint128 potentialLossLimit
);

struct SubBetData {
    uint256 gameId;
    uint256 conditionId;
    ConditionKind conditionKind;
    uint128 outcomeId;
    uint64 odds;
}
```
- while betFor() execution, if the condition (in bet params) was not registered, it is register with the emiting of the `ConditionCreated()` event
```solidity
event ConditionCreated(
    uint256 indexed gameId,
    uint256 indexed conditionId,
    uint128[] outcomes,
    uint64[] odds,
    uint8 winningOutcomesCount
)
```

## Payout on winning bet placed

If the bet wins, the user withdraw payout.
### without freebets
User withdraw payout executing `LP.withdrawPayout(address core, uint256 tokenId)` for single bet or use batch analog `withdrawPayouts(address core, uint256[] calldata tokenIds)` 
The winnings are paid to the owner of the bet token and the BettorWin() event is emitted for each token
```solidity
event BettorWin(
    address indexed core,
    address indexed bettor,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount
)
```
### using freebet funds
User withdraw payout executing batch function `PayMaster.withdrawPayouts(uint256[] calldata freeBetIds)` passing freebet ids.
The winnings are paid to freebet ids owner and the BettorWin() event is emitted for each freebet id
```solidity
event BettorWin(
    address indexed core,
    address indexed bettor,
    uint256 indexed freeBetId,
    uint256 amount
)
```
