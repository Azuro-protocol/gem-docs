As an onchain prediction layer, Azuro offers a modular smart contract infrastructure that supports a plug-and-play solution for blockchains, on the one hand, and prediction apps, on the other. It functions as a bridge between the two and allows for a seamless connection to the most in-demand real-world prediction markets.
