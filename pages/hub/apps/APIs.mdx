### The Graph API

Azuro uses multiple subgraphs to index and organize data from its smart contracts, hosted on The Graph service. This makes querying Azuro data efficient and intuitive. 

Public endpoints cover various environments and blockchain networks both on the testnet ([development](https://gem.azuro.org/subgraph/overview#development-30) endpoints) and in production environments ([production](https://gem.azuro.org/subgraph/overview#production-30)). Note that the testing of live betting occurs in the [pre-production](https://gem.azuro.org/subgraph/overview#pre-production-30) environment.

- Donâ€™t forget to [optimize requests](https://gem.azuro.org/subgraph/request-optimizations) and load game data faster in your frontend.
- There is also an option to enhance performance by creating your [own Azuro subgraph](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/guides/deploying-azuro-subgraph) since we provide the [source code](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/azuro-subgraphs) under the GNU GPL v2 license.
