Returns detailed game status based on game's status derived from the subgraph and start date.

This helper extends the GameStatus from the subgraph. However, it's noticeable that there might not be sufficient statuses to create a detailed UI representation of the game state. For instance, there might be ambiguity in understanding what occurred with the bet between the 'Created' and 'Resolved' statuses.

```ts
export enum GraphGameStatus {
  Created = 'Created', // game was created
  Resolved = 'Resolved' // game was resolved
  Paused = 'Paused', // games was paused
  Canceled = 'Canceled', // game was calnceled
}
```

Thus, we've introduced additional statuses:

```ts {2-4}
enum GameStatus {
  Created, // same as GraphGameStatus.Created
  Live, // game in live
  PendingResolution, // pre-match game status holds for 100 minutes after the start if the game doesn't exist in the live
  Resolved, // same as GraphGameStatus.Resolved
  Canceled, // same as GraphGameStatus.Canceled
  Paused, // same as GraphGameStatus.Paused
}
```

#### Usage

```ts
import { getGameStatus, GameStatus } from '@azuro-org/sdk/utils'

const { status, startsAt } = game // game's data from subgraph

const gameStatus = getGameStatus({ 
  graphStatus: status,
  startsAt,
  isGameInLive: true
})
```

#### Props

```ts
{
  graphStatus: GameStatus // game's status from subgraph
  startsAt: number
  isGameInLive: boolean // should evaluate to `true` if the game from live graph
}
```

#### Return Value

```ts
enum GameStatus {
  Created,
  Live,
  Resolved,
  Canceled,
  Paused,
  PendingResolution,
}
```
