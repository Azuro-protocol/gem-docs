# Overview

**AzuroSDK** is your one-stop solution for building betting dApps on the Azuro Protocol. With a simple [installation](installation), you'll get a fully functional base app that you can [customize](setup) to match your product needs.

The SDK includes a comprehensive set of React hooks and utility functions to streamline development, so you can focus on business logic and user experience — not boilerplate setup.

<Callout type="info">
You’ll often encounter the following types while using the SDK, so we’ve highlighted them upfront:

- **Selection** – Represents a user’s bet selection, used for placing bets and calculating odds.

```ts
type Selection = {
  outcomeId: string
  conditionId: string
}
```

- **BetOutcome**: Detailed info about a user's bet, including odds, game data, and result status. Extends `Selection`.

```ts
type BetOutcome = {
  selectionName: string
  odds: number
  marketName: string
  game: NonNullable<GameQuery['game']>
  wonOutcomeIds: string[] | null
  isLive: boolean
  isWin: boolean | null
  isLose: boolean | null
  isCanceled: boolean
} & Selection
```
</Callout>
