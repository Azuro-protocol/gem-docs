# Overview

**AzuroSDK** is your one-stop-shop for building a dApp on Azuro Protocol. Simply [install](installation) it and youâ€™ll have a basic betting dApp which you can then [customize](setup) to your needs.

SDK provides a comprehensive collection of useful React hooks and utilities for creating your own betting application, eliminating the need to worry about the tedious setup details.

<Callout type="info">
In the future, you may come across the following types often enough, so we've decided to explain them from the get-go:

- **Selection**: Represents the user's choice, main data for bet and odds calculation, etc.
- **Outcome**: Specific data, such as the user's bet (`BetOutcome`) that includes `Selection`.

```ts
type Selection = {
  outcomeId: string
  conditionId: string
  coreAddress: string
}
```

```ts
type BetOutcome = {
  selectionName: string
  odds: number
  marketName: string
  game: GameQuery['games'][0]
  isWin: boolean | null
  isLose: boolean | null
  isCanceled: boolean
} & Selection
```
</Callout>
