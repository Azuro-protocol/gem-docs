The `useLiveStatistics` hook is used to retrieve updated live statistics for an live event.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're using the `AzuroSDKProvider`, you can skip this step.

  Before utilizing `useLiveStatistics`, it is essential to initialize event watchers and the `LiveStatisticsSocketProvider`:

  ```tsx
    import { ChainProvider, LiveStatisticsSocketProvider, useWatchers } from '@azuro-org/sdk'

    export function Watchers() {
      useWatchers()

      return null
    }

    function Providers(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      const { children } = props

      return (
        <ChainProvider>
          <LiveStatisticsSocketProvider>
            {children}
          </LiveStatisticsSocketProvider>
          <Watchers />
        </ChainProvider>
      )
    }
  ```
</Callout>

#### Usage

Subscribe to changes for game.

```ts
import { useGameStatus, useLiveStatistics, type BasketballScoreBoard } from '@azuro-org/sdk'


const { gameId, status: graphStatus, startsAt, sport: { sportId } } = game // game from live subgraph
const { status } = useGameStatus({
  graphStatus,
  startsAt: +startsAt,
  isGameExistInLive: true,
})

const { statistics, isFetching } = useLiveStatistics({
  gameId,
  sportId,
  gameStatus: status,
})

const { q1, q2, q3, q4, state } = (statistics?.scoreBoard as BasketballScoreBoard)
```
