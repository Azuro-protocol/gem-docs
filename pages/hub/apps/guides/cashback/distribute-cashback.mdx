# Distribute Cashback

## Keynotes

### Request Cashback Contracts
Begin by making a [request to the Azuro Protocol team](https://azuro.typeform.com/cashbackpanel) to create Cashback
contracts for your use. Once approved, you will gain access to our Cashback admin panel, and your new contracts
integrated into our subgraphs. As the contract owner, you have the flexibility to withdraw
funds from the marketing budget at any time. Additionally, Cashback contracts will be deployed exclusively
for your affiliate address, ensuring that your funds are allocated solely to your frontend.

### Provide Liquidity
To check the liquidity balance, use the `balanceOf(cashbackAddress)` function on the token
contract. You can top up your contract by simply sending tokens to your cashback contract address, just as you would with
a regular ERC-20 transfer.

### Withdraw Liquidity
When you wish to withdraw liquidity from the contract, call the `withdrawReserve(amount)`
function. Keep in mind that only tokens not reserved for Cashback can be withdrawn.

### Budget Limitation
Please note that we provide you with the flexibility to distribute Cashback
without a budget limitation. However, if your customers claim Cashback for an amount exceeding what you've provided
to the contract, they will encounter an error during the smart contract execution call.

### Use cashback transactions
Private request.
To create a cashback, you need to create a campaign and offer, or use existing ones.
Campaign and offer creation are available in the admin panel.
