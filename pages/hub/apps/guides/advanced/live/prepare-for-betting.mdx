# Prepare user wallet for betting

After you [retrieved games and markets](/hub/apps/guides/advanced/live/data-retrieval), you can start to create a betting flow.
But before your users can start to place their bets, they need to prepare their wallets for betting with the following steps:

### Top up the native currency

The user needs some small amount of native currency to mint test tokens and give an approval to our Relayer smart contract for spending his betting tokens.

Currently, we are live in Polygon Amoy testnet that's native currency is `MATIC`.
To claim some amount for tests, you can use one of the following faucets:

- https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy
- https://faucet.polygon.technology/

or just search for `polygon amoy testnet faucet`.

### Claim test tokens

Bets are placed in ERC20 tokens, currently we support custom `AZUSD` in Polygon Amoy testnet.
The contract address of this token is [`0xf028b2dd00e20a8d9db3964a5feb0633d2ee46cd`](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xf028b2dd00e20a8d9db3964a5feb0633d2ee46cd).

Before a user can start betting, he needs to claim some amount of this token by calling `claim` write method.
Each user can receive 1000 AZUSD once every 24 hours. Users can check if they are eligible to claim the token
right now by using the `availableToClaim` read method, which will return `true` if they can claim and `false`
if they cannot.
We recommend you as a frontend operator to create a convenient interface to do that in 1 click and claim
`1000 AZUSD` to the user's wallet.

### Give a spending approval

In our live betting architecture users don't make transactions, they just sign a message that contains all the bet information and place an order.
This order then been executed by a [Relayer](/contracts/live-relayer) - special backend service for transactions broadcasting.

<Callout type="feature">
  While we work in a testnet, you can ask users to give an approval to spend an unlimited amount of tokens.

### Summary

After finishing all the steps above your users is fueled up with a native currency (that he will need to claim his winnings)
and some test tokens for betting that are ready to be spent.

Now you can proceed with a [betting flow](/hub/apps/guides/advanced/live/place-a-bet) implementation.
