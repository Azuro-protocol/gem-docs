# Implementing EIP712 Signatures

Azuro's migration to the new signature format, [EIP712](https://gist.github.com/markodayan/e05f524b915f129c4f8500df816a369b), introduces key changes to the signature process in Live betting. 

The new format offers enhanced security and improved user experience as it allows users to understand what they are signing, hence the users are more likely to trust the transactions they’re making through your frontend.

### Key changes

- The **`affiliate`** field is now part of the **`bet`** object.
- An **`attention`** field is added, requiring a text of user consent. Its **`maxLength`** is set to 160 characters.

### How to adapt your frontend to support EIP712:

1. **EIP712 Signature Object Structure**
    - **Domain**:
        - **`name`**: "Live Betting"
        - **`version`**: "1.0.0"
        - **`chainId`**: [Your Chain ID]
        - **`verifyingContract`**: [Live Core Address](/contracts/deployment-addresses) (also known as ClientCore)
    - **Primary Type**: "ClientBetData"
    - **Types**:
        - **`ClientBetData`** includes:
            
            ```jsx
            types: {
              ClientBetData: [
                { name: 'attention', type: 'string' },
                { name: 'affiliate', type: 'address' },
                { name: 'core', type: 'address' },
                { name: 'amount', type: 'uint128' },
                { name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256' },
                { name: 'conditionId', type: 'uint256' },
                { name: 'outcomeId', type: 'uint64' },
                { name: 'minOdds', type: 'uint64' },
                { name: 'expiresAt', type: 'uint256' },
                { name: 'chainId', type: 'uint256' },
                { name: 'relayerFeeAmount', type: 'uint256' },
              ],
            },
            ```
            
2. **Message Object**:
    - Contains actual values to be signed.
    - Sample structure:
        
        ```jsx
        message: {
          attention: "User Consent Text",
          affiliate: "0x...", // Affiliate Address
          core: "0x...", // LiveCore Contract Address (also known as ClientCore)
          amount: "1000000000000000000", // Bet Amount
          nonce: "1", // Unique identifier, get it from String(Date.now())
          conditionId: "123",
          outcomeId: 1,
          minOdds: "150",
          expiresAt: 1625097600, // Expiry Timestamp
        }
        ```
        
3. **Integration Steps**
    - Add a text to capture user consent in the **`attention`** field (within 160 chars): for example, “By signing this transaction, I agree to place a bet for a live event on …”
    - Use web3 provider (i.e. MetaMask, etc.) to request a signature from the user.
    - Ensure all fields are correctly formatted and meet the requirements of the EIP712 standard.
    - Send the signed data to the Azuro Live Betting API.
