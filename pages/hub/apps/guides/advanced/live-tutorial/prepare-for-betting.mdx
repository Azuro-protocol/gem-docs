# Adding Live. Step 4: Prepare the betslip

## Update Live **odds**, **condition status** and **maxBet** amount (maxStake) in the Betslip

Live outcomes are individually limited by the `maxStake` value (renamed to `maxBet` in the SDK), which means users cannot bet more than this amount.
You'll receive this information in a websocket message. Additionally, the websocket provides up-to-date `odds` and `status` of the market (condition).

To operate with live bets in your betslip, you need to:
- Subscribe to the websocket for live bets to receive `odds`, `statuses`, and `maxStake` information.
- Calculate live odds using the `calcLiveOdds` utility ([source code](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk/blob/v3.1.0/src/utils/calcOdds.ts#L94)).
- Format the user input for the bet amount to a maximum of 2 fractional digits (`15`, `15.1`, `15.12` - OK ✅; `15.254` - ERROR ❌).
- Validate the live condition status.
- Validate the bet amount against the `maxStake`.

In the SDK, we've implemented the betslip logic ([source code](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk/blob/v3.1.0/src/contexts/betslip.tsx#L93-L94)),
which manages all cases involving prematch and live events.

- It utilizes the `useOdds` hook ([source code](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk/blob/v3.1.0/src/hooks/useOdds.ts), [docs](/hub/apps/sdk/watch-hooks/useOdds))
to calculate and maintain up-to-date odds and maxBet values.
- It leverages the `useStatuses` hook ([source code](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk/blob/v3.1.0/src/hooks/useOdds.ts), [docs](/hub/apps/sdk/watch-hooks/useSelection))
to ensure condition statuses remain current.
- It manages all the validations.

These hooks handle user selections by fetching prematch odds and statuses from the prematch contract
or live odds and statuses via subscription to `oddsWatcher`, `conditionStatusWatcher`, and `websocket`,
as described in the previous step.

**You can use the SDK as is, fork it, or develop your own based on this logic.**
