# Tutorial "Add Live to Existing Prematch dApp"

In this tutorial, we've outlined the minimal changes required for an existing betting dApp that has already manually implemented Prematch betting.

We highly recommend reading the **[Live docs](/hub/apps/guides/advanced/live)** to understand how it functions.
Additionally, familiarize yourself with the logic implemented in the SDK and
the [Example dApp](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk/tree/v3.1.0/examples/nextjs).
Feel free to reuse it.
