# Get Bets History

## Bet Info

To get information about the user-placed bets, you can use the following GraphQL query

```graphql
query Bets(
  $first: Int,
  $skip: Int,
  $where: Bet_filter!,
  $orderBy: Bet_orderBy,
  $orderDirection: OrderDirection
) {
  bets(
    first: $first,
    skip: $skip,
    where: $where,
    orderBy: $orderBy,
    orderDirection: $orderDirection
    subgraphError: allow
  ) {
    id
    type
    tokenId: betId
    amount
    status
    payout
    potentialPayout
    result
    isRedeemable
    isRedeemed
    odds
    settledOdds
    createdAt: createdBlockTimestamp
    txHash: createdTxHash
    core {
      address
    }
    selections {
      odds
      result
      outcome {
        outcomeId
        wonOutcomeIds
        condition {
          conditionId
          game {
            ...MainGameInfo
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

fragment MainGameInfo on Game {
  sport {
    name
  }
  league {
    name
    country {
      name
    }
  }
  participants {
    name
    image
  }
  startsAt
}
```

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      actor_starts_with_nocase: userWalletAddress,
    },
  },
})
```

Each `bets` item represents the result of a transaction, and this transaction can contain several bets at once in the case of an combo bet.
To preserve consistency, there is a `selections` field in the data that contains an array of data about each bet.
For single bets, this field will contain one element.


## Bet Status

The `status` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Accepted`, `Canceled`, and `Resolved`. Note that there is no
middle status similar to `Pending`. Until the outcome the bet was made on is resolved, the status of the bet will be
`Accepted`. If you need to have a status on when a game is in progress - `Live` then you need to extend status value
with using game `startsAt`.

```ts
const isGameStarted = Date.now() / 1000 >= +bet.game.startsAt
const isLive = isGameStarted && bet.status === BetStatus.Accepted
```

It's important to check if bet status is `Accepted` to handle the situation when game is finished and the results are resolved.
Note that in current version of the protocol there is no way to understand when game is finished. So the `Live` status will be
active until the game to be resolved.


## Bet Result

The `result` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Won`, `Lost`.

```ts
const isWon = bet.result === BetResult.Won
const isLost = bet.result === BetResult.Lost
```

Note that until the outcome is resolved `result` will be `null`.

## Market and Selection Names

```ts
import { getMarketName, getSelectionName } from '@azuro-org/dictionaries'

const marketName = getMarketName({ outcomeId })
const selectionName = getSelectionName({ outcomeId })
```

## Pagination

There can be a lot of bets from one user and there can be a problem with fetching all of them at once.

<Callout type="warning">
  From ["GraphQL" section](/subgraph/highlights#limits):

  TheGraph has a limit of returning a maximum of 1000 elements per request, with a default of 100 elements. Keep this
  limit in mind when building your queries. [Read how to paginate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/#pagination).
</Callout>

```graphql
query BetsHistory($first: Int!, $skip: Int!) {
  bets(first: $first, skip: $skip, subgraphError: allow) {
    ...Bet
  }
}
```

```ts
const PAGE_SIZE = 100

const [ page, setPage ] = useState(1)

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    skip: (page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE,
    first: PAGE_SIZE,
  },
})
```

## Combo bets specificity

Key fields:
```graphql
query {
  bets(...) {
    payout
    settledOdds
    result
    selections {
      result
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

Combo bets have type = `Express` and several selections.
It's possible that one of selection can be canceled, in such case combo bet is still active, but `payout` and final odds (`settledOdds` field) are recalculated.

As for this possible case, `payout` and `settledOdss` fields are `null` until the entire bet is resolved.

## Freebets specificity

Key fields:

```graphql
query {
  bets(...) {
    freebet {
      freebetId
      freebetContractAddress
    }
    ...
  }
}
```
If `freebet` field isn't `null`, than this bet is a freebet. It affects how to show payouts: customer will only receive a profit from the winning bet.

Example: Customer got a freebet for 5 USDT (`freebetAmount`) and made a bet. In case of win they will only receive a difference of `potentialPayout - freebetAmount`.
