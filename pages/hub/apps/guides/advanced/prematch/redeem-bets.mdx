# Redeem Bets

When a user places a bet on Azuro, their tokens are transferred to the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract, and they receive
a non-fungible token (NFT) called `AzuroBet-NFT` as proof of their bet.

Once the outcome is resolved, users whose bets have won can redeem their winnings by calling the `withdrawPayout` function
in the LP contract and providing the `betId` of the bet they want to redeem. If a game or a specific condition on the
outcome of which a bet was made is canceled, users can retrieve their tokens back by calling the same function.

The bet NFT also serves as a way to display users' betting history and allows them to track their bets and winnings.


## General required structure

```ts
withdrawPayout(
  core: string,
  tokenId: BigNumberish,
  overrides?: Overrides & { from?: string }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

```graphql
query Bets {
  bets {
    betId
    payout
    amount
    status
    result
    isRedeemable
    isRedeemed
    core {
      address
      liquidityPool {
        address
      }
    }
    freebet {
      freebetId
      freebetContractAddress
    }
  }
}
```

## Regular bets

Customer can redeem bet if it was canceled (`bet.status = BetStatus.Canceled`) or if `result = BetResult.Win`.
There are two flags to simplify the process: `bet.isRedeemable` (customer can redeem) & `bet.isRedeemed` (already redeemed)

You should ensure that `freebet` field is `null`. If it exists, use [freebet redeem](#freebet-redeem)

```ts
const isFreebet = Boolean(bet.freebet)

if (!isFreebet && bet.isRedeemable) {
  const tx = await lpContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayout(
    bet.core.address,
    bet.betId,
  )
}
```

`coreAddress` is required to specify on which `Core` contract user wants to redeem the bet.


## Batch Redeem

<Callout type="alert">
    Please be advised of a critical issue with the `withdrawPayouts` method on the [ProxyFront](/contracts/proxy-front) smart contract.
    Ensure that **ONLY** non-freebet bets are redeemed using this function. We are working on fixing this problem!
</Callout>

To redeem multiple bets at once, you can use `withdrawPayouts` method on the [ProxyFront](/contracts/proxy-front) smart contract.

```ts
withdrawPayouts(
  data: Array<{
    core: string,
    tokenId: BigNumberish,
    // @deprecated
    isNative: false // param exists in current version of contract but doesn't work with combo bets.
  }>
)
```

```ts
const data = bets.map(({ coreAddress, betId }) => ({
  core: coreAddress,
  tokenId: betId,
  isNative: false,
}))

const tx = await proxyFrontContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayouts(data)
```

## Freebet redeem

Note that customer will only receive profit from the bet: `bet.payout - bet.amount`, the body of bet (amount) will be returned to freebet contract.

To redeem freebet use freebet contract.


```ts
const isFreebet = Boolean(bet.freebet)

if (isFreebet) {
  const freebetContract = new Contract(bet.freebet.freebetContractAddress, freebetABI)

  const tx = await freebetContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayout(bet.freebet.freebetId)
}
```
