# Cashouts in Prematch\Live
Cashouts are a feature offered by Azuro that allow bettors to settle their bets before the conclusion of the event. This feature provides flexibility for bettors to manage their wagers by either locking in their potential winnings or minimizing losses based on real-time outcomes.

## Types of Cashouts
Currently, only full cashouts in prematch/live are available. Partial cashouts, which allow bettors to cash out a portion of their stake while keeping the rest of the bet active, are not yet supported.

### Full Cashout
Allows the bettor to settle the entire bet and receive the offered cashout amount. Once a full cashout is completed, the bet is considered closed, and no further outcomes of the event will affect the payout.

## How Cashouts Work
The cashout amount is dynamically calculated by Azuro.
It is influenced by factors such as the current state of the event, live odds, and the likelihood of the bet winning or losing.
Cashouts are available only for certain markets and bets, as determined by Azuro.
