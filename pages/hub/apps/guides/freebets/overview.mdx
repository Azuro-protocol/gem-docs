# Freebets overview

Freebets are a mechanic that allows the product to cover users' bets in order to motivate further engagement. In this case, the user takes no risk when placing such a bet.

The updated freebet mechanic was launched on June 2.

## How to Operate

To simplify operations, freebets are based on **offers**.

An **offer** is a template that defines the conditions for issuing a bonus. It allows you to configure:

- which network the bonus can be used on;
- the specific freebet mechanic;
- min and max odds allowed;
- filters by leagues/sports/markets/etc.;
- how long the bonus remains valid after being issued.

To begin using freebets, you must first create at least one offer, which will then be applied when distributing freebets. It’s not possible to send a freebet without linking it to an offer or specifying settings manually.

Freebets can be distributed in two ways: **manual** or **server-to-server**. In both cases, you must specify: recipient + offer + amount + campaign.

A **campaign** is an optional attribute that helps tag freebets. You can use a short name to later track and analyze the reasons behind their distribution.

## Keynotes

- Each freebet contract is bound to a specific affiliate address, ensuring freebets are available only to your users.
- Freebet distribution doesn’t lock any liquidity until the bet is actually placed. You can create as many freebets as you like (even if your available balance doesn’t cover the total value). However, we recommend using this responsibly: if the available balance is insufficient when a user tries to place a bet, the bet will fail.
- Initially, Azuro will cover gas  for all freebet-related bets. In future updates, gas handling will be transferred to product owners.
- When a freebet is used, the amount is deducted from the product’s balance and sent to the LP.
- If a freebet isn’t claimed before its expiration time, it simply expires and is removed from the user's available freebets list in the REST API. No further action is required.
- If a user places a freebet and the bet is canceled for any reason, the stake amount will be refunded to the product’s balance, and a new freebet will automatically be issued to the user.
- Freebets support two outcome mechanics in case of a win:
    - The freebet amount is returned to the product’s contract balance;
    - The user receives the full payout, including the freebet amount.
- If a freebet loses, it is treated as a regular losing bet — the staked amount remains in the liquidity pool as revenue.
