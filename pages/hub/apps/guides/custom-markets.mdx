The steps to obtain custom markets are the same as for sports markets, but there is a slight difference in how the names of markets and selections are generated.

### GraphQL
For sports markets, you use the [@azuro-org/dictionaries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azuro-org/dictionaries) library to gain names for markets and selections, but for custom markets, you need to use the `title` field from the `Condition` and `Outcome` entities:

```graphql {2, 5}
fragment PrematchCondition on Condition {
  title # it's custom market's name
  # your condition fields
  outcomes {
    title # it's selection's name
    # your outcome fields
  }
}
```

- `title` field in `Condition` entity is custom market's name
- `title` field in `Outcome` entity is selection's name in custom market

<Callout type="info">
 For sports markets this fields will be `null`.
</Callout>

### Title field usage
Make sure you use the `title` field in your market generating function.

```ts {10, 13}
import { getMarketName, getSelectionName } from '@azuro-org/dictionaries'

conditions.forEach((condition) => {
  const customMarketName = condition.title

  condition.outcomes.forEach((outcome) => {
    const customSelectionName = outcome.title

    // If customMarketName has a value, then use it as marketName; otherwise, use the getMarketName function.
    const marketName = customMarketName || getMarketName({ outcomeId: outcome.outcomeId })

    // If customSelectionName has a value, then use it as selectionName; otherwise, use the getSelectionName function.
    const selectionName = customSelectionName || getSelectionName({ outcomeId: outcome.outcomeId, withPoint: true })
  })
})
```
