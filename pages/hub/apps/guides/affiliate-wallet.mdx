## Getting Rewards to your Affiliate wallet

To direct rewards to your wallet address, include it as the `affiliate` parameter in bet transactions. [Read about rewards distribution here](https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/basic/rewards).

```
const AFFILIATE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // Your wallet address to earn rewards

lp.bet(
  core,
  amount,
  deadline,
  {
    affiliate: AFFILIATE_ADDRESS,
    data,
    minOdds
  }
)

```

**Please exercise caution when entering your affiliate address in the production environment.
If you give the wrong address, we can't fix or move associated bets and rewards to a different address.**
Double-check your affiliate address before proceeding. It's crucial to ensure accuracy.

Being diligent will help prevent problems with bet calculations and reward distribution.
