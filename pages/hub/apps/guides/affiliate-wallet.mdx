# Getting Rewards to your Affiliate wallet

To direct rewards to your wallet address, include it as the `affiliate` parameter in [`bet order API`](https://api.onchainfeed.org/api/v1/public/gateway/docs#/Bet%20Public/BetController_createOrderOrdinar). [Read about rewards distribution here](https://gem.azuro.org/knowledge-hub/how-azuro-works/reward-distribution).

```ts {1, 10}
const AFFILIATE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // Your wallet address to earn rewards

const signedBet = {
  environment: '...',
  bettor: '0x...',
  betOwner: '0x...',
  clientBetData: {
    clientData: {
      attention: '...'
      affiliate: AFFILIATE_ADDRESS
      core: '0x...'
      expiresAt: 23401293
      chainId: 137
      relayerFeeAmount: '...'
      isBetSponsored: false
      isFeeSponsored: false
      isSponsoredBetReturnable: false
    },
    bet: {...},
  },
  bettorSignature: '0x...',
}

const response = await fetch('https://api.onchainfeed.org/api/v1/public/bet/orders/ordinar', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',

```
