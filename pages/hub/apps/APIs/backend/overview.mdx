# Backend API

The Backend API is a centralized service that provides critical functionality for the Azuro Protocol, including bet calculation, order management, and cashout processing.

## Overview

The Backend API serves as an intermediary between the frontend applications and the blockchain, handling complex operations that would be inefficient or impractical to perform on-chain. It provides the following key services:

- **Bet Calculation**: Calculates odds, limits, and potential payouts for bets
- **Order Management**: Processes bet orders and submits them to the blockchain
- **Gas Estimation**: Provides gas information for transactions
- **Freebet Management**: Manages freebets and their distribution. [See guide](/hub/apps/guides/cashout/overview)
- **Cashout Processing**: Handles early cashout requests for active bets. [See guide](/hub/apps/guides/cashout/overview)

## Authentication

Most endpoints in the Backend API do not require authentication, as they are designed to be used by frontend applications. However, some endpoints may require a signature from the user's wallet to verify their identity.
