We recommend that you begin with our Quick Start guide that shows what a basic prediction dApp on Azuro has to offer through our SDK. Even if you choose the advanced path, going through the example project in our SDK will give you an overview of our hooks and functions in action.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

To install AzuroSDK and build on top of the example project, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/sdk.git
cd sdk/examples/nextjs
npm install
```

The commands will do the following:

1. Clone the Azuro SDK to your computer
2. Navigate into the example project directory
3. Install all the necessary dependencies for running the project 

When you're ready to start the example project, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and go toÂ `http://localhost:3000`Â to view the application.

### ðŸ‘‰ What to do next?

Now that you know the basics of Azuro functionality, we encourage you to access our onboarding materials, learn what to expect during the first weeks of the integration, and get support from the Azuro team if necessary.
