# SDK v5.3: Social login + gasless

We imbued the AzuroSDK with account abstraction functionality, unlocking social login and gasless transactions to users.

Powered by Privy, Safe, and Pimlico, this release will enable a more user-friendly betting experience akin to web2,
eliminating the need for users to manage seed phrases nor acquire gas tokens in order to submit onchain transactions to the protocol.

**We are confident that these new features and improvements will provide a better user experience and
are excited to see how you will use them in your applications.**
