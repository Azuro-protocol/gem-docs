# Azuro V3 is here! ðŸš€

We officially announce the start of migration:

All clients must migrate to the new version in the next 48 hours. On May 8th, the v2 protocol version will be empty and will stop!

To migrate, update the components to a stable version ([SDK v6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azuro-org/sdk), [Toolkit V5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azuro-org/toolkit), [Demo template v3](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/example-app)) or use the addresses for the [production environment](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/protocol-v3/v3-deployment-addresses#contracts-production).
