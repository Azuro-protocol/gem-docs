[Live Betting](/hub/apps/guides/advanced/live/overview) in the `Polygon Mainnet`.

You can now switch the application mode to "live" for the Polygon network. [Read more](/hub/apps/sdk/providers/live)

## Updates
- `minBet` info and new disableReason `BetslipDisableReason.BetAmountLowerThanMinBet` in [BetslipProvider](/hub/apps/sdk/providers/betslip)
- const `liveBetAmount` marked as deprecated, because live bets are not strictly limited to "1" anymore (use `minBet` + `maxBet` from `useDetailedBetslip()` for live bet value validation).
