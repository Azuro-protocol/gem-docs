# 10/02 Claimable Freebets and eSports

## Introduction

The Azuro Protocol team is excited to announce the launch of freebets for all Azuro Protocol frontend operators.
In this update, we introduce the concept of claimable freebets, making the minting process completely free for
frontend operators. To gain access to the freebets contract admin panel, all you need to do is make a request to
the Azuro Protocol team, top up the contract balance, and kickstart your marketing campaign.

## GraphQL Changes

**Freebet Entity:**

- The `freebetContractName` field has been deprecated as it is no longer necessary.

## eSports Integration

In this update, we introduce enhancements to accommodate eSports conditions within the Azuro Protocol ecosystem.

**Condition Entity:**

- We've added the `isExpressForbidden` field. Certain conditions, such as those related to eSports, now come with
restrictions and cannot be used in a combo bet. To prevent errors, check the `isExpressForbidden` field in condition
subgraph data. If it is set to `true`, you should prohibit such combo bets and display a warning notification
in your user interface.

## Other Enhancements

We've made some additional improvements to enhance the Azuro Protocol experience:

**Event Entity:**

- Added `gasPrice` and `gasUsed` fields to provide more detailed information about events.

## Conclusion

With these updates, we aim to provide a smoother and more efficient experience for Azuro Protocol frontend
operators. Whether you're interested in claimable freebets or integrating eSports conditions, these changes are
designed to empower you with more control and flexibility.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Azuro Protocol team.
