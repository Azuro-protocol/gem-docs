# Introducing Azuro Protocol V3!

<Callout type="warning">
We are planning **Azuro Protocol V3** release around **May 1st**, and **V2 will no longer be supported**. A warning will be issued one week before the release. Throughout April, we will update Azuro Protocol based on feedback without making structural changes. Stay tuned for further updates
</Callout>

This is a major update aimed at significantly improving **odds quality** and **risk management reliability**.

## What’s Changing?

- **Increased protocol revenue** - additional bet validation and improved risk management to counter unfair strategies.
- **Better UX** - a new approach to bet limits, removing backing and slippage in favor of max bets.
- **Higher-quality odds** - eliminating pre-processing and improving data transfer from the provider to the blockchain.
- **Unified validation** - the same process now applies to both pre-match and live bets.
- **Foundation for future upgrades** - preparing for upcoming improvements.

## Additional Tech Upgrades

- **Combo bets** can now include both pre-match and live events.
- **Smart wallets** can now place bets.

## Coming Soon
In upcoming releases, we’ll introduce a **fully revamped sponsored bets system** and two **new free bet mechanics**.
