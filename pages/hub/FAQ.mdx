## Building a dApp on Azuro

#### How to build on Azuro?

You can start building on Azuro on your own by following our [tutorials](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/guides/tutorial) in the Developer Hub. We suggest you start with the [Quick Start guide](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/get-started).

However, to become Azuroâ€™s affiliated frontend and receive monthly rewards and co-marketing help, you need to [book a call](https://calendly.com/azuro_team/30min) with the Azuro team. Only after this step, you will be added to the frontends' [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/azuro/frontends) and will start receiving the monthly affiliate rewards.

#### How long does it take to integrate?

Depending on the requirements of your project, it takes from 1 day to several weeks.

#### Which chains are supported by Azuro?

Azuro operates on Polygon, Gnosis, and Chiliz. However, your dApp users will be able to place bets from other chains [supported by deDridge](https://docs.dln.trade/the-core-protocol/fees-and-supported-chains), as well, since Azuro has added deBridge to its SDK and [tutorials](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/guides/debridge).

#### Does Azuro provide any grants?

All grant information can be found in the [Community Updates](/community/chiliz-grant.mdx) section.

## Revenue

#### Affiliate rewards: how much do the apps on Azuro earn?

Please find the formula for calculating affiliate rewards here in the docs: https://gem.azuro.org/concepts/basic/rewards.
To see how much the current apps on Azuro earn each month, please refer to the [Dune statistics](https://dune.com/azuro/frontends).

#### What if an app's revenue is negative?

If an app has a negative monthly pool revenue, its reward for the month in question will be zero and the negative balance won't be carried over to the next month. See examples in [Dune](https://dune.com/queries/3401984/5709544).

## Promotion

#### Does Azuro help its affiliate apps with promotion?

The responsibility for promotion and user acquisition lies with the frontends. However, Azuro helps to a certain extent by providing particular co-marketing activities after the launch of the app in question on the mainnet. The list, schedule and rules of these activities are available in our Onboarding Hub's [Marketing section](https://azuro-protocol.notion.site/91b821c6082141808585807b0a0dd2ea?v=03c9a83931574f33ad37ff1202690937).
