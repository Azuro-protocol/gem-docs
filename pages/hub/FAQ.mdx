## How to become Azuro's affiliate and receive monthly rewards?

To become Azuroâ€™s affiliated frontend and receive monthly rewards and co-marketing help, [book a call](https://calendly.com/azuro_team/30min) with the Azuro team. After the call, we will set up a Telegram group with our team members to give you dedicated support.

## Can I start building a frontend without contacting Azuro?

Yes, our smart contracts are open and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Azuro-v2-public). Feel free to connect your project to Azuro either manually, or with the use of our [SDK](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/sdk/overview). We suggest you start with the [Quick Start guide](https://gem.azuro.org/hub/apps/get-started).

However, to be able to get rewards, we encourage you to contact us either on Discord, or by setting up a call directly with the team.
